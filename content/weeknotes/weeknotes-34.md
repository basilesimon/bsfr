In other personal news, we had the support of my parents this week, who came to stay with us this week. They helped us clock in full working days (minus the many coffee breaks) in exchange for lovely family dinners.

They tested negative for Covid so they're flying home tomorrow. Sadly.

I reconnected with a buddy from London who, surprisingly, is staying in Berlin for a few weeks. I hadn't seen him since... before we moved to Berlin, before we left the UK, before Covid hit, and before my daughter was born.

We had a quick drink in the park in front of my house, where I usually go to the playground with the little one.

Such a great moment.
