The phone is your best friend. I always thought one's willingness to ring people up made a difference in a newsroom. At least, every time I could be bothered to do it, it was very helpful.

This week, I was struggling with the Tactical Tech brief. As a solo freelancer, I don't feel I can afford to be a little off from what the client has got in mind.

I rang Marek, and 15 minutes later not only things were clear but he also gave me a totally fresh perspective on what we could be doing.

Superpower.

The corollary news from the aforementioned anecdote is that I spent quite some time this week working out a proposal and pitch for Tactical Tech.

I don't want to jinx it, so I won't say anything about it, besides that I'm very excited!

We had the first focus group review of RadarTech, this survey of French public service technical staff. Those who (lol, plural) read these notes every week remember that this meeting was important to me as it could have highlighted that I had done nothing right at all.

Fortunately, this is not what happened. Thanks to everyone's goodwill and eagle eyes, we've got great feedback and lovely new ideas.

We're gathering again in a few days to consolidate and put our favourites on the roadmap.

Sat through seven hours of workshop... interrupted by the most welcome hour of all: picking up the little one from daycare followed by a walk in the sun.

I've published my first bit of Clojure: [the Digital Evidence Toolkit's website](https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/digitalevidencetoolkit.github.io) (_a lot_ more on this later).

Built with [perun.io](https://perun.io), a collection of Boot tasks helping the creation of static sites. It builds and publishes itself with GitHub Actions, and I look forward to having to do more advanced things than publishing a static website from Markdown!
