Excellent week! It was the return of our nanny after two weeks off, and it's fair to say we were all very, very happy to have her again.

Just as the week was tailing off, [Charles](https://twitter.com/cboutaud) asked if I could do a little extra for the [Bureau Local](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/local) about yet another very interesting story. More on this when it's finally out.

For now, I get to audit their data and methodology, as well as to review some Python code.

Picking apart some else's thought so as to understand it is a really fun exercise, and I'm happy The Bureau find it valuable too. [I've written about the difficulties of specialist, technical profiles in journalism](https://blog.basilesimon.fr/2021/03/23/data-journalism-handbook-published/) and (without tooting my own horn too much) getting external help is one solution to this isolation.

In keeping with the flow of nice news, I've got a date booked for the fitting of my 5G antenna and Covid-19 immunisation.

In brief, because I'm writing this on a Sunday evening:

- Had a lovely evening drink on the canal with [Friedrich](https://twitter.com/pudo), freshly departed from OCCRP with big ideas and fascinating plans.

- After Figma a month ago, it's Notion I just discovered. Blown away by how _well_ the UI worked. It all felt seamless, and boy do you know how much I hate editors that get in the way?

- Back to RadarTech after quite a few weeks off. Bit difficult to get back in the groove of my own self-assigned pull requests. What did I mean _back then?_

- Quickly put together a Lambda function periodically hitting the API endpoint we stood up for Global Witness. Comprehensive reporting of errors for free in CloudWatch. Should I have used GitHub Actions like everyone else does at the moment?
