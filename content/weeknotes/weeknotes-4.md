title: "First proper work week - weeknotes #4"

Feels like this week was the first proper work week I had in a long while. I only worked two days, as per the new baby duties schedule, but hey: they were _two productive days_.

I met Lachlan, of Forensic Architecture. They're probably at the very top of my list of places I'd like to work at. Lachlan is a software researcher there, and the ball is very much in my camp regarding coming up with pitches. I'd love to have the time to focus on this...

I sat a technical test for a role I'm interviewing for. From a published story, come up with an alternative visualisations of a dataset, and build it for review with a graphic designer. All right. In under two hours? Gulp. I ended up with this [bar chart-y beeswarm of PAC donations](https://observablehq.com/@basilesimon/misguided-generosity), and I'm not too unhappy given the time constraint. I certainly feel quite rusty, as I'm not writing code day in, day out, these days.

Finding a flight to go to France for Christmas is proving very challenging. Wondering what was going on in the last couple of weeks with tier two and three airports, and how they were doing pax income-wise, I sent a pitch to Flightradar24. More on this later, maybe.

I'm writing a final proposal for the _Direction du Num√©rique_, a French public agency that advises the prime minister and implements policy. They're after a Stack Overflow Developer Survey -- but for public servants working in technical/IT jobs. I'd come in to do some design, survey backend, data analysis, and dataviz.

No news about this health consultancy gig -- I'm reading a little bit about semi Markov models and cost-utility analysis. I essentially need to understand how they go about their business and what they sell if I want to pitch it differently.

Oh, and a bit of relief arrived on the bank account: we have been granted our Elterngeld (literally, "the parents' money"), a benefit for young parents that subsidies a part of their salary for up to 14 months between them. It's retroactive, of course, so the money we received is for the months May to October.

We were lucky enough to be able to sustain ourselves while it took us five months to get the money. What do you do when you need it to make ends meet at the end of the month?
