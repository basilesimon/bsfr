title: 'Mother tongue ain''t easy - weeknotes #10'
---

For the first time in about seven years, I am now working in French, my mother tongue. As a journalist/developer, that's the first time it happens to me. I'm quickly catching up with the debate and the very present choices regarding whether to frenchicise or anglicise words.

It's une uphill bataille.

---

Nevertheless, First steps with [Audrey](https://github.com/AudreyBramy) on the French state contract (let's call it _RadarTech_ for now and hope this name doesn't stick). I've built a little mockup survey app in different frameworks to test out reactivity patterns, server-side rendering, and accessibility.  
We're both keen on learning some GraphQL, and I've got big hopes that this will allow very atomic payloads for a dataviz project. 

So, without too much hesitation, [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) it is!

I've had a conversation with _Deutsche Welle_, who are looking for a data journalist for about  three days a week.

Three days a week... That sounds fine, or so I used to think. Realistically, does that leave enough time to develop one's own business and clients? I've not made up my mind yet.

---

Baby news: we've got a spot at the Kita. 300 metres away from home won't be an amazing daily cycle, but I won't complain at the perspective of having five to seven hours a day (!!) to do some work. That will start end of January 2021. Exciting new thing ahead!

### Thing of the week
You don't necessarily need a full `<svg>` or `<canvas>` implementation to do simple things. 

In this Observable notebook, I demonstrate an animated, pure `<div>` i and CSS3 transitions bar chart, drawing on `d3` (geddit?) only for what it does best: selections and data bindings.

### Read
- [Black Forest Thinking](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n20/andrew-o-hagan/short-cuts), by Andrey O'Hagan for the London Review of Books (for which he's editor-at-large). One of my favourite writers, and a good primer on the need for _frische luft_.
- [Inside Glenn Greenwald's blowup with The Intercept](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/10/inside-glenn-greenwalds-blow-up-with-the-intercept.html), by Peter Sterne for NYMag. TL;DR: famous journo too precious and special to be edited, also hates the young guard for being flowers and deplatformers. Good laugh.
- [50,000 Covid-19 deaths and rising. How Britain failed to stop the second wave](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/health-coronavirus-britain-newwave/), by my former colleagues Ryan McNeil on the data, and many others.
