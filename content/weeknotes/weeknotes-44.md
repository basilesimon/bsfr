title: Second shot, missed tile - weeknotes #44'
---

I got to visit the Berlin Velodrom, though not to dawdle and look at pretty track bikes but to receive my second shot. In keeping with my life story so far, I received the Pfizer/BionTech (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª) after a first injection of Astra (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§).

Spent a work day at a new coworking in NeukÃ¶lln, with an AC, a pantry full of fruits and drinks, and a symmetrical gigabit connection. As I wrote before: it's the leaving to work and the being away at work that feels different.

A good deal of work done on the [Digital Evidence Toolkit](https://digitalevidencetoolkit.org). From the [latest newsletter: "Our idea"](https://digitalevidencetoolkit.org/newsletter-3.html), I revamped the homepage so it reads more detailed than before (hopefully).

I'm also working on a strand of work which aims to support the editing of additional metadata about a record. Say you save a webpage or something -- you may want to add some free text or tags or whatnot. This data isn't part of the the record itself, but I see a place for it nevertheless.

Blast from earlier this year: the Tactical Tech project I used to wrangle with is back on the table: the boss wants it finished soon-ish. That's going to be a bit difficult for me.

So instead we're looking at expanding it a little bit, and someone may be dangling a carrot of an upcomging Amsterdam exhibition to motivate the troops...

I went riding and _tilebagging_ at the weekend. It's the activity consisting in visiting as many contiguous 1x1km "tiles" as possible. Always gives you somewhere to ride, you see.

Well, I got lost in the forest and thus missed a tile, then on the way back I forgot I had to follow the satnav to a tee and missed the pontoon that would have given me that otherwise rather aquatic tile.

Ah well, I'll have to go back...

Wait, August??!
