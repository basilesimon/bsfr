Hi from Paris! Feels a bit odd to be travelling considering the seemingly sudden surge in Covid cases in Europe. Our apathy towards this in October and November being illustrated rather well by this Die Zeit viz:

I've been translating a few basic charts templates into React, JSX, and TypeScript. Kind of fun. As I mentioned before, I kind of indulge in how much I get to learn through trying to accurately type constructs I've used for years, be they DOM manipulations of D3 abstractions.

Case in point: this isotype, in Observable below, and [now in `.tsx` too.](https://github.com/etalab/radar-tech-frontend/blob/master/src/components/charts/BarreDePersonnages.tsx)
