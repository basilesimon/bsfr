Attempt number _#n_ to find a rhythm and a balance between family imperatives and my desire to do some work, so as to find some self-satisfaction outside of the baby bubble.

Met [Niko](http://niko.io/), formerly from the Syrian Archive, for lunch, round the corner from where we both live. There are still a lot of folks I need to reach out to, but Berlin is already shaping up as a very interesting city, work-wise.

Since the usual meetups aren't on (for obvious reasons), I'm thinking about putting together a regular gathering of five or six, to broaden my Berlin social and professional circle. Maybe folks could bring someone else, and I'd get to jump through _n_ degrees of social separation this way?

Sorted a lot of paperwork and mementos (hoards?) from the past few years. Clean shelves and desk for a clear work head, I guess.

First "Family Day": a workday dedicated to family activities. This week, we cycled to the southeast of Berlin, along the rivers that shape this region. Forests a-plenty, plane-spotting on the final to SXF/BER, and everyone quite happy with yet another outdoors afternoon.

### TKTK

+ A "tea and armament" afternoon meeting with a Deutsche Welle colleague who's also in charge of little humans.
+ A "human rights and sandbox" play date at the Spielplatz next week with someone I need to meet and who straight of the bat mentioned he'd need to bring his six-month-old to our intro meeting. Loving Berlin.
+ We're taking the little one to Berghain in a few weeks to tour [the exhibition](https://www.studio.berlin/)
