title: 'First-class history hoops - weeknotes #41'
---

Still in France. I've not dont a tremendous amount of work this week due to a general lack of time and focus. Everybody's doing their best but sometimes it's just challenging.

Work opportunities keep coming ‚Äì and I'm grateful for it. Most notable this week was a job for the [Bureau of Investigative Journalism](https://thebureauinvestigates.com/), which looks manageable in time and quite interesting.

Good progress on the Digital Evidence Toolkit. Some of it was on the research side so is yet to be published. I worked on the first and second steps to surfacing the history of a record:

- [#20 - support for listing the history of a record/block](https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/deptoolkit-node-api/pull/20)
- [#26 - surface the history of a ledger inscription](https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/deptoolkit-node-api/pull/26)

"History" as far as the ledger is concerned isn't straightforward. It's first-class of course, but tied to the _block_ (which form the chain) and not the _documents_, so it's somehow one-step removed from view.
