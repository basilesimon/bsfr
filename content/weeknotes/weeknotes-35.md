title: 'Touch-and-go week - weeknotes #35'
---

Bit of a special week which was all, as per the headline, touch-and-go. Monday was a public holiday in Germany, then my partner and I alternated looking after the little one during the afternoons as our nanny was off. Throw in an occasional errand and a walk-in doctor's appointment and you've got a rather weird week!

We had nevertheless decided to keep to our "sprint" plan with the Deutsche Welle, which kept me busy most of the week. We've improved the workflow a lot since last time: most notably we've reduced the "contact hours" of video meetings...

There's now going to be quite a bit of soul-searching regarding what I want my relationship with them to be. More on this later...

I was working from a new place: a small flat in Kreuzberg, not too far from home. I could ride there in minutes and ran back-and-forth a couple of times, which doesn't amount to much but still: it's the commute break that counts.

I worked from an (old) Thinkpad and an iPad with bluetooth headsets for long calls and resource-heavy software (ðŸ‘‹ MS Teams). Which meant I could _close my laptop_, _head out_, _after work_.

It had been a while.

Good evening progress while my partner socialised with colleagues tracking PST:

I moved forward with the backend of the [Digital Evidence Toolkit](https://digitalevidencetoolkit.org/) and its interfacing with the ledger, so I can [list all records](https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/deptoolkit-node-api/commit/9fa16ac81efd17d0610d319ce3ff23effefac2a9) and [insert new records](https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/deptoolkit-node-api/commit/18b76f6c531539cb06f6d7298f045ad1d09b494e), which also works from [the browser extension](https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/firefox-extension/pull/2/files).

I'm also trying [`ai/nanoid`](https://github.com/ai/nanoid/) while I'm at it: it boasts being four times as small as `uuid/v4` and quite a bit faster. I've enlisted the help of someone who knows about IETF and RFCs, because I really don't.

Soon, hopefully: pushing screenshots, which means fiddling with storage of documents.

I've not been to Tokyo but I love these bonkers architectural creations of the 70s.
- ["How Michel Foucault Lost the Left and Won the Right"](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/opinion/michel-foucault.html) by the NYT's columnist Ross Douthat. Not sure that the "how" is well proven, but the author's point regarding the absence of Foucault from the debate after a year and a half of follow-the-science politics and social restrictions is interesting.
