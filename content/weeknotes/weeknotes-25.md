This is going to be a short one: I somehow didn't take notes through the week.

Following rounds of feedback and very valuable suggestions (ðŸ™Œ), RadarTech's deadline is extended by six to eight months, well into November. As we were discussing how the work would take place over the coming year, we thought I could work two days in June, two days in September, and then keep some availability in between, and we should be good, I shouldn't have to help to launch the final product since we designed it four months before.

Part of me felt that there is a cost to tuning on and off from a project and a code-base, and that had I known it would be a year-long project my budget proposal would have reflected that.

We had another very interesting conversation with Deutsche Welle, who are working on projects related to verification. 

Obviously the "news innovation" spiel reminds me of the old days at BBC News Labs. Unlike how things used to go back then, the structure, contracts and money are really well defined, however!

I'll write about this more in the coming weeks as I know more about the work and the "sprints" we are scheduling.

Most of the week was in fact spent building bits and bobs for the Tactical Tech project, which deadline is fast approaching.

Svelte, d3, Typescript, Ramda compositions. What's there not to like?

I'm drawing heavily on the sketches I've made in Observable. Thinking in code pays off: I've been able to move my stuff over to Svelte fairly painlessly.
