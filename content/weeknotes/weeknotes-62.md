title: "Moving to a monthly format - weeknotes #62"
---

Hello, December.

I probably won't be publishing weekly notes this month, in a trial of a monthly format instead. I've moved some of my notes from [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/) to [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and the upset in my life is simply too great for me to just write about at the minute.

Speak in a few weeks, then!
