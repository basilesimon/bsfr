Big week on [the Digital Evidence Toolkit](https://digitalevidencetoolkit.org). We're in the home stretch and I feel the pressure mounting.

I spent a bit of time doing further work on editing records, as well as designing some of the static assets for promotion, social media, etc. Turns out I'm being asked to _show_ the product a lot.

My answer so far is that it's visually un-interesting and that the value proposition is in the technicalities more than in the design. Still, I feel I should oblige.

I spoke to loads of people and for the first time since I started the project, I felt okay doing so. I'm no longer pitching some blue-sky thinking, but something that I trust I'll deliver shortly.

In returns of coming to these meetings with assumptions/ a certain opinion, I get _extremely valuable_ user feedback questioning what I've done – I know, duh.

Things like _“How do I work across multiple cases with your tools?”_, which I had totally not thought of. Mind blown.

Among these meetings, an old friend and colleague at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism walked me through a research tool marketed towards law enforcement: [Hunchly](https://hunch.ly). But more importantly we found out he used to live in the same building I am now in Berlin, 15 years ago!

[ECCHR](https://www.ecchr.eu/en/) were amazing and I hope there will be more engagement with the _Investiging Commons_ group (which includes Forensic Architecture, Bellingcat, ECCHR, HKW...)

And finally, a contact at the UN with a background in government and the FBI told me about their investigative woes... and some potential spin offs of the Toolkit for the public/private sector.

I had a bit of a quiet afternoon doing some maintenance for Global Witness. As I was spinning up new test machines, I took this opportunity to finally put together my own [“First 5 minutes on a server”](https://aboutbryan.com/2013/03/03/my-first-5-minutes-on-a-server-or-essential-security-for-linux-servers/) Ansible playbook, complete with setting up a sensible shell with history.

Bliss.

In personal news, I got to play a bit of bike polo this week, which was nice. A Berlin tournament is coming at the end of September – the occasion to train a little bit.

More problematically, this week was a note-taking meltdown as I started to replicate some things between [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) (at home in emacs), [Athens](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens) (a Roam clone written in Clojure) and [Notion](https://notion.so) (which I use to collaborate with people and whose UI is just up there).
