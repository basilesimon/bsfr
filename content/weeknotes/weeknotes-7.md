A lot of waiting for things to happen. Or, for that matter, for things to _not happen_.

You guessed it: the job at the newspaper I was so keen on didn't work out (see [previous note]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/10/29/weeknotes-6/)). Fair, though, it would have been pretty extraordinary to hire a non German speaker.

I've re-equiped this blog and website with analytics, as I'd like to know how successful is my portfolio-building effort, and do people actually visit the pages I'd like them to read. As per [Thomas'](https://oncletom.io/) recommendation, I'm using [matomo.org](https://matomo.org/), which I'm hosting and which I've set to respect Do Not Track flags.

I had a meeting with the team that I'll be working with for the French _Direction du Num√©rique_ (see [previous note]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/10/16/weeknotes-4/)). Really looking forward to having this signed and to start doing some work.

### TKTK

Three months till the end of our savings at our current burn rate, we're enlisting the help of a nanny to help us with looking after the little one. Right now, work is done at the expense of the other's time -- and as we're both trying to make it back into the workplace, we need some help.

Happy to see how it feels having a stranger and a proper professional around!
