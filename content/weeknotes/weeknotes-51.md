title: 'Stack jumping every day - weeknotes #51'
---

Back to work after a week off, and now approaching a year of writing these weekly notes. I had lots of _life admin_ stuff to do early in the week – things I had left for later after some time focusing solely on the Toolkit.

This week was the first week _"after"_ the Toolkit, and I chopped it down into three clients.

I worked two full days for Deutsche Welle, the German broadcaster. No meetings, just logging in and doing some work. I spent this time reviewing the codebase for a project called KID, which has to do with training resources about disinformation.

It's a ClojureScript app so this was straight in the deep end.

I'm starting from the front-of-the-frontend and bringing in sharper, more consistent styles, and working my way down the stack. Hopefully.

I dedicated one day to jumping back into a Tactical Tech project which has now been extended (and topped up). There are new ideas I want to pitch but I feel I miss a system/method to do so. One I can use by default, when a client doesn't impose _their_ method of working or submitting work. See below: "Mise en place for Knowledge Workers." 

---

And I also spent a day (well, almost) similarly getting back into Radartech, this survey and dataviz project for the French administration.

I started the [Exercism Clojure track](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure) to practise the language a bit. The exercises are varied and have kept me interested so far!

Will next week be this varied, I wonder?

### Read
- [“Mise en place for knowledge workers”](https://fortelabs.co/blog/mise-en-place-for-knowledge-workers/), by Tiago Forte of Forte Labs. Really interesting in terms of balancing new methods, tools, and constant learning with needs of expertise and efficiency, which I read from a solo freelancer's perspective.
- As a corollary to the above, I've got [”Stop learning”](https://www.nashvail.me/blog/stop-learning) by Nash Vail in my list too.
