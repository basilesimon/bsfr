title: "Expect not too much personal news - weeknotes #46"

Second-to-last business week before submitting the v1.0 deliverables for the Digital Evidence Toolkit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's all I did this week.

[Last week](weeknotes/weeknotes-45), I wrote:

> Turns out I’m being asked to show the product a lot. My answer so far is that it’s visually un-interesting and that the value proposition is in the technicalities more than in the design. Still, I feel I should oblige.

To help me with this, I commissioned [La Loma](http://laloma.info/en), a Berlin-based design agency whose visual vocabulary I really love. They came highly recommended by folks around the Tactical Tech group.

Can't wait to see what this will look like!

[The latest newsletter is out!](https://digitalevidencetoolkit.org/newsletter-4.html) As for the previous ones, I'm trying to sharpen the answer as to _why_ this project came to be. And in this issue, we're discussing metadata.

I got a bit of feedback on the writing after it went out, and am happy to receive more :)

In the trenches, three main tasks this week:

- [Displaying a richer record history](https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/deptoolkit-node-api/pull/38) with some SQL and d3.js,
- Moving the Firefox extension in the monorepo, which is causing a lot of woes (cheers modern JS for the 500 packages required by Webpack for a three-file browser extension),
- [Exporting of a working copy](https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/deptoolkit-node-api/pull/41), a day-zero feature.

And I'm plugging away at the final piece of the puzzle: the verification of an archive.

And finally, the personal things section. I was sick for a full day-and-a-bit, and now I've passed it on so I didn't manage to clock in quite as much exercise as I wanted. But hey, I played a bit of polo before getting real sick, so I call this a win.
