Hold on – March? I know February’s always a bit shorter than usual (I love this [Britannica summary](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-are-there-only-28-days-in-february)) but boy was this one short. I blame a combo of physical therapy (twice a week) and a whole lot of running (~120km this month, a lot by my standards) for the relative scarcity of long work days.

I started a couple of new things this month:

- I joined a **Correctiv/Beabee project** creating a **local-journalism-in-a-box** software to enable communities to set up a membership system (💰) and interaction with their community. That will be ~10 days a month for the foreseeable, and is probably the largest codebase I’ve worked on. Everybody involved is remote, and it’s been good fun so far.
- I also started a **collaboration with the Digital Threats to Democracy team at Global Witness**, designing experiments **testing hypotheses about TikTok and political leaning.**

And some things are carrying on:

- I’m preparing a hosted version of the [Digital Evidence Toolkit](https://digitalevidencetoolkit.org/), per request of a person in Berlin. That means moving to a remote store (hello, S3) and thinking about how to permission delivery and database additions.
- Speaking of, there are two funding opportunities that, fingers crossed, I’ll have more to tell you about when I publish March’s notes... 🤞

- What I talk about when I talk about running
- “[Propositional density in dataviz](http://well-formed-data.net/archives/495/propositional-density-in-visualization)”, an oldie from Moritz Stefaner, about _“the associative, evocative character of our visual information vocabulary”_ with wondeful examples
- [“How to capture satellite images in your backyard”](https://theconversation.com/how-to-capture-satellite-images-in-your-backyard-and-contribute-to-a-snapshot-of-the-climate-crisis-167327), by Sophie Dyer (Amnesty) and Sasha Engelmann (Royal Holloway Uni), which – come on! – makes you want to place an order and spend some time faffing outside
- [“What I learned running a SaaS for a year”,](https://onlineornot.com/what-learned-running-saas-for-year) by a guy who’s run a SaaS for a year.
