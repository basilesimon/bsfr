The introductions to the Berlin NGO/activist scene continue.

Among others, I've met Jeff, from the Syrian Archive. We had met in Berlin two or three years ago when they were getting their first grants and I was keen on us/Airwars being friends with the new cool kids. Three years later, what a fantastic project the Syrian Archive has become!

I've received documents and data from a medical health consultancy and I need to work out a few pitches from it. Visualising and explaining their statistical and machine learning models would be fascinating from my perspective, but the company is a business after all, so I'm rather thinking about what would add value _from their clients' perspective._

### TKTK
- A technical test, for which I don't feel so at ease since I'm not writing code/remembering syntax every single day.
- A nicer audio library from the NAS.

### Read
Quite a few things in German (NZZ, Deutsche Welle) -- each article seems to take me hours.

Also renewed my subscription to The Economist.
