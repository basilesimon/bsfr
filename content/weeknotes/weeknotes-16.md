We have a new person helping us look after the little one for a few afternoons a week, and we're so happy with her. Today was also baby's introduction to Kita (kindergarten), which means that in a few weeks she'll be with kids her age and looked after by pros a few hours every day.

That is, if Covid things improve, and that's not a sure thing in Germany:

In the meantime, I'm stretched a little thin considering how few hours I've got.

We're planning a first deliverable of our survey for the RadarTech project, commissioned by the French public service. This follows an end-of-sprint review this week. Good news: the plumbing GraphQL-d3 works well. [First viz out of the door](https://observablehq.com/@basilesimon/isotype-sketch-a-wee-people-bar-chart) below, in "Thing of the week."

I'm giving a hand to [Tactical Tech](https://tacticaltech.org/) on one of their [Glass Room](https://theglassroom.org/) project. Very tight deadline to push this over the line.

Covid times are making them think about alternatives to physical, real-world exhibitions, and one area for this mind-blowing project to spread its wings is naturally online. That's where I come in.

First things first, though: before agreeing to take this on, we've agreed I'd do one day of exploratory data analysis, for which I'll charge them anyway. I would be very curious to know what other data/viz folks who work solo do before agreeing to pick up a project.

This week was also my first half-day with Global Witness (whom you may remember from [an earlier 2020 job](https://blog.basilesimon.fr/2020/10/21/portfolio-global-witness-pipedown-map/index.html?pk_campaign=clickthrough&pk_kwd=portfolio)). I'm now helping them tidy up and maintain some of their infrastructure, as well as providing second opinions and code reviews to their Data and Investigations team.

Which is going to be fun, and it had been a while since [Louis](https://twitter.com/ltrgoddard/) and I were in the same Slack instance ðŸ‘‹

### Thing of the week

I've been tinkering with how to represent people-specific data points from a survey, i.e. how many respondents describe themselves as x or y?

I built this [isotype-bar-chart (full notebook)](https://observablehq.com/@basilesimon/isotype-sketch-a-wee-people-bar-chart):

### Read

- [The German "Word of the Year"](https://blogs.transparent.com/german/german-word-of-the-year-2020/) - I love "systemrelevant"
- [How Silicon Valley, in a Show of Monopolistic Force, Destroyed Parler](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/how-silicon-valley-in-a-show-of-monopolistic), by Glenn Greenwald on his new Substack. Very interesting counterpoint to the overwhelming cheer for knocking off Parler from the Internet.
