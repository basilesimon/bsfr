Hello, November!

---

I spent most of my working hours in workshops for the Deutsche Welle, who's been given a pot of money to work on projects related to uses of AI to fight (mis/dis)information.

Lots of people in a Teams meeting... turned out to not be so bad. Miro is an amazing tool and the workshop facilitators did a really good job of keeping the whole affair feeling snappy and quick!

I [gave an interview to Amazon's Jackson Kelley](https://console.substack.com/p/console-78), who runs the Console newsletter. We talked about the [Digital Evidence Toolkit](https://digitalevidencetoolkit.org/) from the perspective of open source software.

From the resulting newsletter signups, hello to the [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives](https://www.atf.gov/) staff. I'd love to hear about your interest in this project.

After much faffing and inability to finally decide to spend something north of two grands on a new laptop, a rental MacBook Air M1 arrived on Friday.

The straight-out-of-the-box smell of the is just like it's always been – there's no way these things aren't designed, right?

Went to see _No Time to Die_ – it had been a while since I last went to the movies. My calendar says not since October 2019.

The movie was a good laugh, and a fitting goodbye to Craig's Bond. Everybody kicks absolute ass, but it's not quite as the shock _Casino Royale_ was or the mood _Skyfall_ had about it.
