title: 'Hello from the holiday side - weeknotes #49'

Well, there we are: September. Closing in on a year of such weeknotes now.

Iâ€™m writing this from an iPad and [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io), a web browser-based dev environment. I didnâ€™t think we had come this far with usability, to be honest. Iâ€™ve got a REPL running on the JVM running in another tab, all the nice VSCode extensions and my own little dev environment and preferences, and I didnâ€™t save anything when I closed the laptop Berlin and packed the iPad. 

Not that Iâ€™d want to use it a great deal: the iPad without a physical keyboard is not really appropriate for dev work.

Anyway, itâ€™s my week of holiday this week. Weâ€™re in the northern part of the Brandenburg state (very close to Angela Merkelâ€™s childhood home, Templin). Not much will be happening besides riding the bicycle around, family time, and thinking about the autumn season and what jobs Iâ€™ll take.

Until then, ðŸ‘‹
