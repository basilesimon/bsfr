title: 'Spanner in the works - weeknotes #37'

Well, this is yet another note I end up publishing on Monday morning. I should probably aim for a different schedule: it doesn't seem like I can make Friday evenings most weeks.

In my defense, it was a difficult week. The little one had an eye infection thing which meant no daycare. We took it as a bit of a challenge and while both of us did _some work_, my overall feeling is that I spent the week coping with the bits and bobs that needed doing right now while being constantly interrupted.

So that's that. Sometimes it's not all rosy.

After three weeks only, I gave back the temporary office-flat I had hired for a month. Too much of a home to be a proper office... but not my home at all, so I'm not free to reorganise the whole place. 

My main takeaway is that _going off to the place you work_ is cool and helpful in all kinds of ways. But this flat wasn't what I want my office to be.

With this renewed commitment to my home office, I set out to sort the networking situation. The modem-router from Vodafone wasn't able to handle having old devices (Thinkpad, old smartphones) on the Wifi channels, and parts of the flat are no-go zones for video calls.

Or rather: "were no-go zones."

On friends' recommendations I bought some UniFi gear and _voila_, here I am writing you from the future of prosumer gear. It's worth it, people.
