## Read

(since I've been hanging out in coffee shops a bit this week, I got some reading done!)

- [“No Man's Land: The Trench Stalemate”](https://acoup.blog/2021/09/17/collections-no-mans-land-part-i-the-trench-stalemate/), Bret Devereaux's latest [multi-part](https://acoup.blog/2021/09/24/collections-no-mans-land-part-ii-breaking-the-stalemate/) historical vulgarisation essay about trench war in WW1.
- [“Things unlearned”](https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/things-unlearned) by Jamie Brandon. A hodge-podge of great bits about programming and solving problems.
- [“Babel – Could a machine have an unconscious?”](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-40/essays/babel-4/) by Meghan O'Gieblyn for n+1 mag, a writer's essay about writing-AI GPT-3, which I found really deep and thought-provoking.
