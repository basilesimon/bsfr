Merry Christmas and holiday season, everyone. I've got very little time this week, and I must confess confess I am writing this note a day late.

I've done a bit of reading about ClojureScript and Reagent, following
[Bastien's](https://bzg.fr/) recommendation of [David Nolen's ReadME interview](https://github.com/readme/david-nolen). I really enjoyed his arguments in ["Why ClojureScript" on the ClojureScript Podcast](https://overcast.fm/+R1c3vsXWA) by Jacek Schae.

I'm going to enjoy the snow and the mountains now. See you next year.
