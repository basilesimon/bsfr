## I turn datasets into long term stories
Since the beginning of western airstrikes against Isis, [Airwars.org](https://airwars.org) has held militaries across the world to account for the harm they have caused to civilians. This work was made possible through the creation of **a dataset collating military reports and OSINT investigations into claims of civilian harm**. This project and stories have spanned years and led to meaningful change, not only raising the bar for public accountability of their governments but holding those in power in check.

During my time at [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com) we published several pieces [about the unraveling of the nuclear deal](https://graphics.reuters.com/IRAN-NUCLEAR/0100B0660CC/index.html) between Iran and the so-called P5+1. I created a dataset that **tracked the progress of Iran’s commitments to the deal in terms of its efforts to enrich Uranium which underpinned much of the reporting.**

I've covered the (never-ending) Brexit saga for a number of years and devised bespoke maps of the British political spectrum on the topic. This has involved manipulating the [raw voting records](https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-EU-LEADER/010092Q33KW/index.html) and feeding the results [to a simple machine learning clustering algorithm](https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-brexit-rift-machine-learning/).

## I specialise in reactive data-visualisation
For several newsrooms I have covered (more than enough) elections. They are the bread and butter of news nerds' work and involve standing up both a back end and front end which picks up results as they come in and redraws charts and analysis live (as well as without forcing the reader to refresh).

Think of [big dashboards of live data](https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-general-election-2019-britain/), for lack of a better image.

I am also familiar with building projects which involve readers directly engaging with content, like our [survey of knowledge of modern slavery in Britain](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/child-trafficking-boys-lured-by-dreams-of-football-stardom-forced-into-sex-slavery-9qr53xpkw), our analysis of [changing attitudes to divorce](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/meet-the-new-breed-of-happy-divorcee-women-who-are-empowered-positive-and-thrilled-to-be-single-7skzg3k8s), or our [2017 Budget calculator](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-2017-budget-calculator-mwx5jwwjl/). 

## I support investigative journalism work
Part of my time is spent working as a technologist and advisor to investigative journalism organisations, such as **Global Witness** and **The Bureau of Investigative Journalism**.

Some of that work consists of code reviews, data audits, and system administration. Out of the trenches, I advise on infrastructure and systems architecture to support the work of these teams.

### I read about (and would give a kidney to report on) the following topics:
*  digital sleuthing and OSINT techniques,
*  bias in statistical models and policy,
*  defense and armament (and exports thereof),
*  the West's new fights against radical ideas,
*  bread-making and bicycle-adventuring

## Open source work
Fortunately I was able to open-source some of the work I have done:
+ [noaastorms](https://github.com/basilesimon/noaastorms), an R package to download, parse and clean historical storms data from the NOAA
+ [twitter-tools](https://github.com/basilesimon/twitter-tools), a Python toolkit to monitor deleted tweets, automate screenshoting, and archiving
+ [d3-grid](https://github.com/basilesimon/d3-grid), a fork in d3v4 of the beloved d3-grid
+ The Times' [dataviz catalogue](https://github.com/times/dataviz-catalogue), a public resource of data viz code and designs

## Academic work
I had the privilege of teaching the Advanced Data and Coding module on the MA in Interactive Journalism course at City University. We ran through an introduction to programming, statistical methods, R data analysis and modelling with ggplot.

All my teaching notes are [available on Github](https://github.com/basilesimon/interactive-journalism-module).

I have done some studying myself:
+ Master of Arts in Multimedia Journalism - Univ. of Westminster (UK)
+ Masters in Political Science and Sociology - High European Studies Institute (France)
+ BA Private Law, minor Political Science - Univ. Lyon III (France**
