I am excited to share a new article published on Opinio Juris, co-authored with [Sabrina Rewald](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/srewald), [Emma Irving](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-emma-irving-80329548/), and [Kate Keator](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-t-keator/).

As generative AI reshapes the digital landscape, legal frameworks are struggling to keep pace. In our piece, ["When Tech Disrupts Faster Than Rules Adapt,"](https://opiniojuris.org/2025/12/16/when-tech-disrupts-faster-than-rules-adapt-drafting-emergency-guidance-for-ai-affected-evidence/) we address the urgent need for updated standards in digital investigations.

Drawing on collaboration between the Starling Lab and [the Fénix Foundation](https://www.fenix.foundation/), we introduce the concept of **"AI-affected evidence"** to capture the nuance of AI-generated, modified, and surfaced material. We identify emerging gaps in established standards like the Berkeley Protocol and propose eight evidentiary pillars to guide fact-finders. This article details the first four: **Auditability**, **Corroboration**, **Provenance**, and **Prejudice**, adapting them for the AI era.

We invite you to read the full post and join the conversation on how we can better support investigators in this changing landscape.
