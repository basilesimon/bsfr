Joy of joys, I am in Italy again.

This year again, I came to Perugia for the [International Journalism Festival](https://www.journalismfestival.com/), where I moderated a panel about career paths for news nerds.

[Or lack thereof, really](https://www.journalismfestival.com/programme/2018/career-paths-for-news-nerds.-or-lack-of-them).
