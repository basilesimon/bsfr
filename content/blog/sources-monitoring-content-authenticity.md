title: "A Call for Community Sources on Content Authenticity"
---

The content authenticity ecosystem is experiencing unprecedented growth and evolution. With the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org?ref=basilesimon.fr) (CAI) now [boasting over 5,000 members](https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/5000-members-building-momentum-for-a-more-trustworthy-digital-world?ref=basilesimon.fr) and C2PA specifications maturing rapidly, keeping pace with developments across multiple working groups, technical specifications, and industry implementations has become increasingly challenging.

As someone working at the intersection of these technologies through [Starling Lab](https://starlinglab.org)'s partnerships with newsrooms and legal accountability projects, I've witnessed firsthand how quickly this space moves ‚Äì¬†one example being the [Creator Assertions Working Group](https://cawg.io?ref=basilesimon.fr) (CAWG) which joined the Decentralized Identity Foundation, adding another layer of complexity to an already rich technical landscape.

Meanwhile, C2PA adoption is expanding with real implementations like [Sony's](https://authenticity.sony.net/camera/en-us?ref=basilesimon.fr) and [Leica's](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/photography/content-credentials?ref=basilesimon.fr), as well as the recently-launched [Pixel 10 from Google](https://petapixel.com/2025/08/20/google-pixel-10-series-hands-on-whats-new-for-photographers?ref=basilesimon.fr) ‚Äì¬†all producing Content Credentials for the photographs they take.

The challenge isn't just technical ‚Äì¬†it is in fact informational. With C2PA technical working groups meeting regularly, CAWG operating under new governance structures, and CAI fostering quarterly community events spanning topics from deepfakes to photojournalism, **the sheer volume of signal across mailing lists, GitHub repositories, meeting minutes, and specifications makes comprehensive monitoring a significant undertaking.**

**This is why I'm reaching out to the community for help.** At Starling Lab, we've seen how these technologies translate into real-world impact through our journalism fellowships and authentication frameworks, but we know there are countless other developments happening across member organizations that deserve broader visibility.

**A community publication could serve as a valuable aggregation point**, helping practitioners, researchers, and industry members stay informed about everything from new CAWG identity assertion specifications to emerging industry adoptions. But first, we need to map the information landscape effectively.

Your input on key sources ‚Äì¬†whether working group minutes, critical GitHub repositories, or essential mailing list ‚Äì¬†‚Äîwill help determine the scope and approach for this monitoring effort. Together, we can create a resource that serves this fast-growing community's need for clear, consolidated information about where content authenticity is heading.
