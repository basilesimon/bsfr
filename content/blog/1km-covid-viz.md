![](assets/covid-viz-terrain.png)

So, I'm in France right now, and with this lockdown going on we're quite restricted on the physical exercise front.

Technically we're allowed to go out for a sweat, but can't go for longer than an hour a day, and no further than a one-kilometre radius away rom home.

With this in mind and for no particular reason I set off to cycle, run, or walk every street in this virtual confinement circle.

I applied similar techniques [as before](blog/strava-rides-map-in-r) to collect my Strava activities and overlay them on a collection of OpenStreetMap.
