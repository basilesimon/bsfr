**An original data-driven experiment looking at how Brexit splits the Tories. Modelling of a dataset to test a hypothesis.**

### Project course
The project came to be as a backburner piece for my contribution to the Europe, Middle East and Africa Reuters file: a kind of backgrounder, explainer story we could mention and push out again every once in a while.

The central question was whether we could back up the feeling Lobby reporters had that there were several groups of Tories, so-called "tribes," with different attitudes to Brexit â€” while Labour parliamentarians were relatively united in pushing back against Theresa May's deal.

**[The main Reuters Graphics story](https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-EU-LEADER/010092Q33KW/index.html)** studied 12 key votes on amendments to the deal, which were fascinating as they reprensented new ideas from parliamentarians about what to do about Brexit.

**[I also published a follow-up looking at 238 votes](https://blog.basilesimon.fr/2019/10/06/brexit-machine-learning/)** and feeding the records to a machine learning algorithm, which as it was a lot more speculative was not Reuters' cup of tea.

### Data work and modelling
To make out groups of MPs, we looked at their voting record. I'm forever grateful to [Evan Odell](https://evanodell.com/), who maintains R packages I've used through my time in news.

[@evanhodell/hansard](https://github.com/evanodell/hansard)'s was used to fetch a bunch of data from an original [Institute for Government](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/) research, which highlighted recent Brexit-related votes.
