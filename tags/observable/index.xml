d3-render packages up a bunch of d3 commands in a declarative shell, inspired by a eather functional and reactive approach. @unkleho has got a lovely tutorial introducing the library, but here&amp;rsquo;s another one from yours truly anyway.
Implementation It&amp;rsquo;s going to work this way:</description></item><item><title>Comparing Berlin memorial street plaques datasets</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/stolpersteine-maps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/stolpersteine-maps/</guid><description>Here are two quite different datasets, which supposedly represent the same thing. Hard to miss how different is the extent of their geographical coverage.

Background In the night of Nov 9 to 10, 1938, Nazi Germany&amp;rsquo;s SA forces carried out a devastating pogrom. The event came to be called Kristallnacht, &amp;ldquo;The Night of Broken Glass.&amp;quot;
Last week, as I walked in the street in the evening I noticed that some of the brass plques had candles and roses next to them, a silent and unattended vigil in the street.</description></item><item><title>A beeswarm layout in Observable -- on deadline</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/observable-beeswarm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/observable-beeswarm/</guid><description>I recently had to complete a technical test for a role I&amp;rsquo;m interested in.
The task: from a story out of the Global Witness website, can you come up with an alternative visualisation? You&amp;rsquo;ve got two hours.
As there were no embed constraints, I figured there was no point in faffing with boilerplate code and scaffolds, so I went down the Observable route to put a chart together.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what we need scales-wise:</description></item><item><title>Machine learning's take on the Brexit's House of Commons</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/brexit-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/brexit-machine-learning/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say things are a little confused over here in Brexit Land. To put it lightly, it has become difficult to explain, or simply to fathom what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen next.
A few months ago I looked at the rift splitting the Conservative Party, but the topic kept nagging me.
Obviously the &amp;ldquo;indicative votes&amp;rdquo; were a great tool to identify the Brexit &amp;ldquo;tribes,&amp;quot; as they represented such varied opinions, allowing us to build a mental picture of the different kinds of Brexit MPs could support.</description></item></channel></rss>
