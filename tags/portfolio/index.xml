Modelling of a dataset to test a hypothesis.
Project course The project came to be as a backburner piece for my contribution to the Europe, Middle East and Africa Reuters file: a kind of backgrounder, explainer story we could mention and push out again every once in a while.
The central question was whether we could back up the feeling Lobby reporters had that there were several groups of Tories, so-called &amp;ldquo;tribes,&amp;rdquo; with different attitudes to Brexit â€” while Labour parliamentarians were relatively united in pushing back against Theresa May&amp;rsquo;s deal.</description></item><item><title>Portfolio case study: Reuters' 2019 general election results page</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-general-election-2019-britain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-general-election-2019-britain/</guid><description>A node backend and a modular, reactive front page visualising the UK general election results, as they happened. For Reuters Graphics.
Unfortunately, this page was deleted from the internet.

Some context The EU has a rule in place to regulate which electricity and fossil fuel projects it will financially support. These projects include the terminals and pipelines used to import and transport fossil gas â€“ sometimes referred to as natural gas. Under this regulation, selected gas projects get fast-track approval and access to billions in public subsidies.</description></item></channel></rss>
