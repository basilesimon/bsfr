Technically we&amp;rsquo;re allowed to go out for a sweat, but can&amp;rsquo;t go for longer than an hour a day, and no further than a one-kilometre radius away rom home.
With this in mind and for no particular reason I set off to cycle, run, or walk every street in this virtual confinement circle.</description></item><item><title>noaastorms R package now supports NOAA IBTrACS v4</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/update-noaastorms-r-package/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/update-noaastorms-r-package/</guid><description>Earlier this year, I released a simple R package (available at basilesimon/noaastorms) that downloads, cleans and parses NOAA IBtrack data for you.
As the NOAA updated its datasets, noaastorms is now using these!

The authors present their application of &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; science techniques to datasets coming from the humanities &amp;ndash; mostly large corpus of texts, legends and myths.
One paper in particular uses bioinformatics and phylogenetics to study the spread of a popular folk tale: Little Red Riding Hood. The story that I knew from Perrult and Grimm has patterns that are also found in African and East Asian tales.</description></item><item><title>New R package: load and chart oceanic storms</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/noaastorms-r-package/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/noaastorms-r-package/</guid><description>Mapping historical storms data is now a little bit easier. Off the back of this blog, I have authored an R package (available at basilesimon/noaastorms) that downloads, cleans and parses NOAA IBtrack data for you.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration releases datasets known as International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship.
These datasets are updated regulary and cover all our oceans. The data found in there is fantasticly detailed and goes back as far as 1850 in some case (I wonder how!</description></item><item><title>Strava rides map in R</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/strava-rides-map-in-r/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/strava-rides-map-in-r/</guid><description>This is a Christmas present to myself to celebrate 10,000km of commuting on my bicycle: a lovely frame print of all my GPS traces on a home-made map of London. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I made it.

Step one: getting Strava data The process has become slightly convoluted in May 2018. In the past, it was possible to download a Strava archive which contained all activities as GPX; however, GDPR regulations led to a change in bulk export format.</description></item><item><title>Pen plotter maps in R</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/pen-plotter-maps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/pen-plotter-maps/</guid><description>I made a sweet Christmas present for my friend ClÃ©ment, who cycles far too much. Last year he got himself a nice custom bicycle made and started documenting his travels.
So I grabbed the lot and started playing, and I pen-plotted his journeys on postcards.

The death toll currently stands at nine, and hundreds were injured.
The north western Pacific basin sees many storms, and meteorology agencies release loads of data about climate events such as these. For this example, we are going to use the work of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which releases datasets known as International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship.</description></item></channel></rss>
