No meetings, just logging in and doing some work. I spent this time reviewing the codebase for a project called KID, which has to do with training resources about disinformation.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a ClojureScript app so this was straight in the deep end.</p><p>I&rsquo;m starting from the front-of-the-frontend and bringing in sharper, more consistent styles, and working my way down the stack. Hopefully.</p><hr><p>I dedicated one day to jumping back into a Tactical Tech project which has now been extended (and topped up). There are new ideas I want to pitch but I feel I miss a system/method to do so. One I can use by default, when a client doesn&rsquo;t impose <em>their</em> method of working or submitting work. See below: &ldquo;Mise en place for Knowledge Workers.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>And I also spent a day (well, almost) similarly getting back into Radartech, this survey and dataviz project for the French administration.</p><hr><p>I started the <a href=https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure>Exercism Clojure track</a> to practise the language a bit.
