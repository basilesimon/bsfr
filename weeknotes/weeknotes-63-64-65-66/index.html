Consequently, I spent a good deal of this month worrying about care, surgery, pain and future recovery. 0/10 would like this to not happen again.</li><li>There were family celebrations over the festive period, and we spent half the month in France. All of it got turned upside down several times because of the resurgence of the virus, but I feel blessed nonetheless.</li><li>My folks helped us get over the uncharted territory hump and sent my partner and I away for two nights while they looked after the little one. Our first childless holiday since her birth. And you guessed right: two morning sleeping in.</li></ul><hr><p>Now, work-wise. So‚Ä¶ Aside from a few actual work days, I spent most of these few working hours preparing 2022. That means emailing some folks I contact periodically, sending an actual pitch for a three-month project, and replying to an open call for consultancy from Tactical Tech. That also means sorting out a few unknowns on the accounting front and wanting at my partner about how complicated things are in Germany and how little I can work out about some pretty important things like health insurance and my precise bottom line.</p><p>What I know however is that <strong>we renewed my contacts with Global Witness and the Deutsche Welle for assignments covering all of 2022!</strong> üéâ</p><p>Without hitting the jackpot yet, I‚Äôve done some thinking about a simplified infrastructure for Global Witness Data & Investigations as I sunset legacy bits, and what a cool Wireguard VPN √† la Tailscale could unlock regarding resources I really need to keep very private.</p><p>The buzz-themes of the month were <strong>web3</strong> and <strong>datalog</strong>, mostly by virtue of having several friends and colleagues interested in the same things at the same time.</p><p>I did no work on the <a href=https://digitalevidencetoolkit.org>Toolkit</a> but had two amazing meetings ‚Äî one of which was with Ilya and Ed from <a href=https://webrecorder.net/>Web Recorder</a> who are way ahead drafting the <a href=https://webrecorder.github.io/wacz-spec/>spec for WACZ</a>, an interoperable web archiving format and tools.</p><p>Finally, no real surprise there but I didn‚Äôt manage to publish some Moon dataviz sketches, let alone turning them into Christmas presents.</p><h3 id=reading-list>Reading list</h3><ul><li><a href=https://www.ft.com/content/8399873e-0dda-4c87-ba59-0e2678166fba>‚ÄúResearchers train AI on &lsquo;synthetic data&rsquo; to uncover Syrian war rimes‚Äù</a>, by Madhumita Murgia, technology correspondent at the FT</li><li><a href=https://flowingdata.com/2021/12/13/leland-wilkinson-creator-of-the-grammar-of-graphics-passed-away/>‚ÄúLeland Wilkinson, creator of The Grammar of Graphics, passed away ‚Äù</a> üò¢</li><li><a href=https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-12-06/spam-spies-sms-how-it-works>‚ÄúSpam, Spies, SMS: how it works‚Äù</a> by Crofton Black for the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</li><li><a href=https://www.ft.com/content/8fbd120f-9377-4a7c-8c6f-c0b0a620b2f4>‚ÄúSleaze will be hard to clean up while the data remains so opaque‚Äù</a>, by Max Harlow, who knows a good deal about British open data, on the FT</li></ul></content><p></p></article></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Bear</a></footer></body></html>
