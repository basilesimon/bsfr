In a sudden burst of Waldzweisamkeit, I spent quite a few evenings in the forest, my local gravel cycling trails, so to speak. It&rsquo;s a nice place for a quiet drink in the evening, though the hunt for cool temperatures last week was a lost cause.

Nobody at home was feeling well. Didn&rsquo;t do a huge amount of work, if I&rsquo;m honest.</p><p>In a sudden burst of <a href=https://blogs.transparent.com/german/untranslatable-german-words-waldeinsamkeit/>Waldzweisamkeit</a>, I spent quite a few evenings in the forest, my local gravel cycling trails, so to speak.

I was a little nervous and spoke too quickly, and I&rsquo;m a bit saddened I didn&rsquo;t finish a big chunk of work ahead of demoing it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s essentially the user story that goes: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a prosecutor and I&rsquo;ve been handed over this hard drive with material on it, as well as this <em>recipe</em> for proving its provenance and origin. What do I do?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know yet how I want this look and feel, but I want to nail this down soon.</p><hr><p>I had a good chat to Chris from <a href=https://airwars.org>Airwars</a> about cloud v local storage, managed v self-hosted services. It was excellent user feedback, and I hope to settle on a solution soon.</p><p>We also had a full day of pair work with Niko, which I&rsquo;m still processing. I&rsquo;m moving all these little things into a nice pull request which I hope to get to this week. It was a very interesting programming exercise and an eye-opener to a different programming discipline.</p></content><p></p></article></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo Ê•â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê” Bear</a></footer></body></html>
