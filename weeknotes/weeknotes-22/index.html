If all my clients could be this helpful!</p><hr><p>Contributed to Ben&rsquo;s project to stand up a proper stack for interactives at Global Witness, which has to integrate with editing workflows and the CMS. It&rsquo;s ambitious but Ben&rsquo;s got some really nice building bricks together already.</p><p>Ahead of the conversations with the website and CMS people, the idea was to max out performance and delivery. So I had a play with CloudFront, AWS' in-house CDN offering. Verdict: 30-50% faster than static assets from a Svelte app stored in an S3 bucket. ðŸ˜³</p><hr><p>So, <a href=https://niko.io/>Niko</a> has joined Deutsche Welle&rsquo;s <a href=https://innovation.dw.com/>Research and Cooperation</a> team, and we&rsquo;re now discussing how I could help their projects having to do with verification.</p><p>I also emphasised I&rsquo;d be keen on their accessibility and performance in dataviz work strands, but if I&rsquo;m honest I&rsquo;d be interested in quite a few things if it&rsquo;s with them and Niko.</p><p>I mean just <a href=https://innovation.dw.com/team/>look at that team!</a></p><hr><p>My in-laws are in town for a few days &ndash; the pandemic made us miss St Nicholas Day (huge in these parts), Christmas (also huge), and the little one&rsquo;s birthday (they haven&rsquo;t seen her in months).</p><p>Much wine drinking to catch up with, so that&rsquo;s it for this week!</p></content><p></p></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo Ê•â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê” Bear</a></footer></body></html>
