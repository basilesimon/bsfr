What about <em>that one</em>?</li><li>Can I break these into smaller problems?</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m also adding constraints in there. Having but little time to do something is one ; another is that I&rsquo;m not a software engineer or legal expert by trade but that these two domains are principal components of my problem.</p><p>The progress made delights me, however. I hope to share some news soon.</p><hr><p>Speaking of sharing news (and I alluded to it last week), I&rsquo;m the final stages of bringing in a researcher to do some ground work for me ‚Äì including back-tracking and taking the time to explain what it is I&rsquo;m doing here.</p><p>I think I&rsquo;m realising that once I&rsquo;ve worked something out (for myself) I happily move one without ever spending the time to explain it. That may be why I&rsquo;m not great at The Twitters and The Social Media.</p><hr><p>The Data & Investigations team I support at Global Witness launched a new piece from the <a href=https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/forests/>Forests campaign</a>, which aims to raise awareness of the destruction of climate-critical tropical forests.</p><p>You can punch in a (British) postcode <a href=https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/forests/how-long-would-your-local-park-survive-deforestation/>in the interactive</a> and let Ben show how quickly your local park would disappear&mldr; in real time. Mind-bogglingly scary stuff.</p><p>I did some load-testing with <a href=https://artillery.io/>Artillery</a>, a tool I had wanted to try for a while. Initial thoughts:</p><ul><li>It lived up to my expectations of simplicity&mldr; and customisation</li><li>I may have over-tested a bit. I don&rsquo;t think we were quite looking at these 3,000 signups in 10 minutes üòá</li></ul><p>And an oddity cropped up in our CloudFront CDN distribution: readers in Belgium, Denmark and Germany were reporting missing Origin headers and thus pages failing to load. The whole distribution wasn&rsquo;t including these headers, right. I only tested for half an hour but I did quite a few other countries, and only in these three did I find systematic failures.</p><p>Curious.</p><h3 id=read>Read</h3><ul><li><a href=https://blog.roastmylandingpage.com/landing-page-roasts/>‚ÄúWhat I learned roasting 200 landing pages in 12 months‚Äù</a> - a small business success story with boat-loads of valuable lessons for anybody who&rsquo;s got a shopwindow website</li><li><a href=https://www.settle-in-berlin.com/berlinflatquest/>The Berlin Flat Quest</a> - a newsgame with lovely aesthetics about <a href=https://www.settle-in-berlin.com/berlin-flat-quest-the-game/>‚Äúcollective frustration‚Äù</a></li></ul></content><p></p></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Bear</a></footer></body></html>
