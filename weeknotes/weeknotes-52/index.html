<meta name=title content="A year of weeknotes - weeknotes #52"><meta name=description content="One year writing these notes.
When I started, I was very much trying to go back to work, struggling to find more than a few hours here and there.
Since then:

I found work 🎉 and negotiated my rate and conditions with different kinds of clients,
I got to say no to assignments for various reasons,
When it got too busy or difficult, I set boundaries and made time for flexibility and family (the huge perks of this lifestyle),
And since today, I lived through the difficulty of having to dump a client.


A year into this notes is as good a time as any to think about these full-time employment opportuinities that arise every so often. It would mean no more admin, no more thinking I&rsquo;m &ldquo;losing&rdquo; a day&rsquo;s wages when I&rsquo;m doing things for myself. Ah well, I&rsquo;ll choose on merit of each opportuinity."><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://basilesimon.fr/weeknotes/weeknotes-52/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="👋 hi, I’m basile"><meta property="og:title" content="A year of weeknotes - weeknotes #52"><meta property="og:description" content="One year writing these notes.

I&rsquo;m trying to concentrate (centralise?) non-essential, let&rsquo;s-try-it-for-a-few-month services instead of running each little thing on its own VPS.
