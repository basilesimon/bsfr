I should probably aim for a different schedule: it doesn&rsquo;t seem like I can make Friday evenings most weeks.</p><p>In my defense, it was a difficult week. The little one had an eye infection thing which meant no daycare. We took it as a bit of a challenge and while both of us did <em>some work</em>, my overall feeling is that I spent the week coping with the bits and bobs that needed doing right now while being constantly interrupted.</p><p>So that&rsquo;s that. Sometimes it&rsquo;s not all rosy.</p><hr><p>After three weeks only, I gave back the temporary office-flat I had hired for a month. Too much of a home to be a proper office&mldr; but not my home at all, so I&rsquo;m not free to reorganise the whole place.</p><p>My main takeaway is that <em>going off to the place you work</em> is cool and helpful in all kinds of ways. But this flat wasn&rsquo;t what I want my office to be.</p><hr><p>With this renewed commitment to my home office, I set out to sort the networking situation. The modem-router from Vodafone wasn&rsquo;t able to handle having old devices (Thinkpad, old smartphones) on the Wifi channels, and parts of the flat are no-go zones for video calls.</p><p>Or rather: &ldquo;were no-go zones.&rdquo;</p><p>On friends' recommendations I bought some UniFi gear and <em>voila</em>, here I am writing you from the future of prosumer gear. It&rsquo;s worth it, people.</p><hr><p>Thanks to my efforts and the team&rsquo;s discipline, we received our lowest AWS bill ever for the Data and Investigations team at Global Witness. Next best thing to do to cut costs: cutting me.
