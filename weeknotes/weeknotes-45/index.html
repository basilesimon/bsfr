I&rsquo;m no longer pitching some blue-sky thinking, but something that I trust I&rsquo;ll deliver shortly.</p><p>In returns of coming to these meetings with assumptions/ a certain opinion, I get <em>extremely valuable</em> user feedback questioning what I&rsquo;ve done ‚Äì I know, duh.</p><p>Things like <em>‚ÄúHow do I work across multiple cases with your tools?‚Äù</em>, which I had totally not thought of. Mind blown.</p><hr><p>Among these meetings, an old friend and colleague at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism walked me through a research tool marketed towards law enforcement: <a href=https://hunch.ly>Hunchly</a>.

As I was spinning up new test machines, I took this opportunity to finally put together my own <a href=https://aboutbryan.com/2013/03/03/my-first-5-minutes-on-a-server-or-essential-security-for-linux-servers/>‚ÄúFirst 5 minutes on a server‚Äù</a> Ansible playbook, complete with setting up a sensible shell with history.</p><p>Bliss.</p><hr><p>In personal news, I got to play a bit of bike polo this week, which was nice. A Berlin tournament is coming at the end of September ‚Äì the occasion to train a little bit.</p><p>More problematically, this week was a note-taking meltdown as I started to replicate some things between <a href=https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam>org-roam</a> (at home in emacs), <a href=https://github.com/athensresearch/athens>Athens</a> (a Roam clone written in Clojure) and <a href=https://notion.so>Notion</a> (which I use to collaborate with people and whose UI is just up there).</p><h3 id=read>Read</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HxVMGaiZbc">‚ÄúClojureScript in the age of TypeScript‚Äù</a> by David Nolen, which to be frank isn&rsquo;t really what the bait title lets you think. ‚ÄúHow I REPL into things because we use cljs‚Äù, rather.</li><li><a href=https://engineering.nanit.com/6-years-of-professional-clojure-2b61cb6c1983>‚ÄúSix years of professional Clojure‚Äù</a>, by Erez Rabih (on Medium)</li><li><a href=https://qbix.com/blog/2016/11/17/properly-valuing-contributions/>‚ÄúProperly valuing contributions‚Äù</a>, by Qbix.
