I liked this pace: it felt like this wasn&rsquo;t a hobby, but my job proper. I hope this continues through the spring and summer.</p><p>It currently feels like I am in a jungle, surrounded by tall grass and trees. I&rsquo;ve got my imaginary machete and am just whacking trying to find a way through.</p><p>This week, I whacked at ledger ideas and offerings:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.datomic.com/>Cognitect&rsquo;s Datomic</a>, a transactional database for the JVM ;</li><li>and <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/>Amazon&rsquo;s QLDB</a>, managed and cloud-based.</li></ul><p>Both systems are built on this idea that <strong>the log is the database</strong> ‚Äì not the documents it contains or their relationships between one another.</p><hr><p>Prototype Fund pays for two days of professional coaching (to pick from a set of companies they chose), on a variety of topics from security to user-centered design.</p><p>I figured I shouldn&rsquo;t pass on an opportunity to do something new, but I really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. I ended up having a short intro call with a product strategist at Zero360 ‚Äì and I found it to be a very interesting experience.</p><p>It was kind of like seeing a shrink: I started talking to them to explain why I wasn&rsquo;t sure about this appointment, what my project was about, what I thought my challenges were at the moment, etc.</p><p>On the fly, I had to order my thoughts a little better, so as to communicate them to someone else (duh, that&rsquo;s what <em>language</em> is about).</p><p>The person I spoke to didn&rsquo;t even say a great deal, but I thanked them for ‚Äúa helpful conversation,‚Äù and I thought it was a pretty funny experience.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll do this again.</p><hr><p>It&rsquo;s also the first time of my <em>new</em> career, i.e. my solo freelance one, that I look for external paid help. I&rsquo;ve hinted at this in previous weeknotes but am more and more serious about it.</p><h2 id=read>Read</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCZ3YgeEUPg">‚ÄúDesign, Composition, and Performance‚Äù</a> by Rich Hickey.
