It&rsquo;s been a crazy week, I thought today was the 23rd.
 The little one had a bout of fever. That meant hospital, being shouted at profusely, and quite frankly ridiculous nights.
The funny thing with these occasions is how quickly your priorities redefine themselves. For example, I&rsquo;m very much up against the clock for Tactical Tech but I can tell you I chose the extra sleep this morning ‚Äì and I would do it again."><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:title" content="A bout of fever - weeknotes #26"><meta property="og:description" content="26th weeknotes, published on March 26.

Well, maybe March 27, actually, who knows?</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a crazy week, I thought today was the 23rd.</p><hr><p>The little one had a bout of fever. That meant hospital, being shouted at profusely, and quite frankly ridiculous nights.</p><p>The funny thing with these occasions is how quickly your priorities redefine themselves. For example, I&rsquo;m very much up against the clock for Tactical Tech but I can tell you I chose the extra sleep this morning ‚Äì and I would do it again.</p><hr><p>Unrelated to the very temporary stressful and sleepless situation, I&rsquo;m thinking about scouting out a workplace for a couple of weeks. I really need some focus if I mean to deliver.</p><p>And as an echo to the point above about priorities: this may mean not being available to help and in touch with how the household is doing.</p><hr><p>The new Datajournalism Handbook was published this week! It was a huge effort drawing on 73 authors and is one of the first things I ever read about datajournalism and that we go through every year with my students at City.</p><p>I contributed a chapter called <em>‚ÄúCoding with data in the newsroom‚Äù</em> (the title got edited, okay) and is about the challenges faced by technical types in a newsroom environment. I&rsquo;ll write a short blog outlining what I wrote shortly.</p><hr><p>I had to say no to the Bureau (of Investigative Journalism), who put out a widely picked up investigation into the pay of Deliveroo riders ahead of the company&rsquo;s IPO. As previously, Charles wanted me to audit their methodology, code, and data.</p><p>Unfortunately, I had so little time to spare over the weekend I couldn&rsquo;t do it. I took an hour off the books to chat through thoughts, but it felt weird saying no to them.</p><hr><p>And some good news about RadarTech: we&rsquo;re looking into adding more time to my booking ü§ò, and I worked out the Gatsby way of generating an arbitrary number of pages and routes from a list of objects.</p><p>It&rsquo;s nice when things work out.</p></content><p></p></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Bear</a></footer></body></html>
