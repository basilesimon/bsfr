These two weeks (this past, about which you&rsquo;re reading, and this coming, during which you&rsquo;re reading this) are a bit of a lull:</p><p>The grant for the Toolkit is ending but has not quite ended yet ; we&rsquo;re about to go away on holiday ; and I&rsquo;m contemplating being back to my previous projects in a few weeks' time.</p><p>The end of the grant will be a sort of send off, a deluge of social media promotion of our projects. Which is nice, but&mldr; One, it will all be taking place in German ; two, I&rsquo;m not clear yet how sizeable is the overlap between their audience and the niche I&rsquo;ve been talking to for this project.</p><p>In short: this end of August is rather less momentous than I thought it&rsquo;d be.</p><hr><p>Three things to report on the Toolkit front:</p><ul><li>The <a href=https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/deptoolkit/releases/tag/0.10.0>last release (v.0.10.0)</a> includes the work I&rsquo;ve mentioned last week: a new <code>docker-compose</code> orchestration and tests, tests, tests. Thanks again Friedrich and ClÃ©ment!</li><li>I&rsquo;ve swapped the black-and-white mono fonts for a very startup-y look. <a href=https://digitalevidencetoolkit.org>Check out the website</a>, and don&rsquo;t laugh: the feedback so far is really positive. Yeah, I know&mldr;</li><li>And I&rsquo;ve had really interesting conversations (read: kind of user interviews) with two international lawyers with experience of special tribunals (e.g. former Yugoslavia, Cambodia, Lebanon). Super interesting perspectives.</li></ul><hr><p>Quite a lot of maintenance on Global Witness' AWS, deleting some old junk accounts, IAM roles, policies, EC2 boxes&mldr;</p><p>Boring but will hopefully make a big difference in terms of visibility and graspability of our tools.</p><hr><p>One of the things I&rsquo;m going to come back to is Deutsche Welle, the German broadcaster. Niko and I did a pairing session to walk me through the project that&rsquo;s going to pay our bills &ndash; and which, according to plan, he&rsquo;s started in ClojureScript.</p><p>I&rsquo;m really grateful for this real-world opportunity to spend time learning something. Sounds like it&rsquo;s going to be a biggie!</p></content><p></p></article></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo Ê•â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê” Bear</a></footer></body></html>
