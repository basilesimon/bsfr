That&rsquo;s the moment where data, programming and editorial choices really all collide.</p><p>Observable notebooks are proving very helpful tools allowing me to quickly tweak sketches while sharing my screen over video.</p><p>The project will bring in a mix of static SVGs and code-driven charts, with ever-so-fiddly annotation layers overlaid. If I have got time, I will look into how I could combine static files with Svelte to drive some of the styles from the JS side.</p><hr><p>In my chase of focus time, I went as a guest to Factory, a hip Berlin coworking space/startup place-to-be which has a privacy policy to get in.</p><p>It was my first time back in an office â€“ though one that has a ball pit. I can&rsquo;t say it didn&rsquo;t feel a little odd having actual people (strangers!) around.</p><p>And while I was only mere minutes away from home, I was wholly unavailable to help with daily things and baby duties. Felt nice, might do it again.</p><hr><p>AWS things at Global Witness. Resisting the urge to try to write that small microservice in ClojureScript.</p><hr><p>A bit of spring cleaning in my dotfiles, which have recently grown a little to accommodate flavours of Svelte, Clojure(Script) and Org-Roam.</p><p>Applying the actual <code>use-package</code> syntax across several functions (<code>:keyword (value)</code>), I noticed from the inconsistencies between many of the snippets I gathered when putting these bits of config together that I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who had not read <code>use-package</code>&rsquo;s documentation.</p><hr><p>I attended <a href=https://bzg.fr>Bastien&rsquo;s</a> <em>Atelier Blue Hat</em>, which had to do with using and promoting open source software and licenses in Europe and in the public service.</p><p>Following this, Bastien announced a new open source licence for public service codebases, to force other administration to contribute back to the software they use: the <em>Great Libre Open Source Software</em>.</p><p><a href=https://mastodon.etalab.gouv.fr/@bzg/105989221259348029>Here&rsquo;s the announcement</a> â€“ do note the publication date.
