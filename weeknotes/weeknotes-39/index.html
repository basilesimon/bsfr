The coach walked me through some exercises to end up at a <em>‚ÄúNorth Star metric‚Äù</em>, and the way there was quite interesting.</p><p>The questions seem simple, but when they&rsquo;re asked of you, live on video, it&rsquo;s not always that simple and clear in your head!</p><hr><p>Excellent conversation with Global Witness. As I wrote before, I&rsquo;ve cut costs so much that the lowest hanging fruit to go further is to reduce my own hours!</p><p>Six months into this gig, I thought it was time for a bit of a reset, and I&rsquo;ll now be formulating an end of year goal to expand my support of the team further. Something a little bit more ambitious than staying abreast of what this team is up to.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve noticed I&rsquo;ve actually specialised quite a bit and that while I&rsquo;m very plugged in to what the newsroom dev/ dataviz person could find useful, I often need a bit more of a catchup when it&rsquo;s about my colleagues who focus a lot more on data and investigations.</p><p>As an external consultant and contributor to this team, I feel really pleased and grateful I was listened to, particularly since I needed to air a bit of frustration.</p><hr><p>Our short-term neighbour (read: sublet) left a Fender acoustic guitar in the hall. The same I&rsquo;ve got at my folks, though mine is sunburst, which as we know is cooler. I hadn&rsquo;t touched a guitar in such a long time my partner didn&rsquo;t even know I could play.</p><p>Now me and the little one are practicing our scales and chords together.</p></content><p></p></article></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Bear</a></footer></body></html>
