Fixing the y-axis (instead of running it from minimum to maximum) shows how the Oscar transfer to a Chinese club skews the analysis.</p><p>French midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin&rsquo;s Â£24m fee seem little in comparison to Oscar&rsquo;s Â£60m.</p><hr><h3 id=snakey-chart>Snakey chart</h3><p><img src=assets/TransferWindow1.png alt></p><p>Inspired by <a href=http://www.wsj.com/graphics/elections/2016/how-is-your-state-swinging/>this WSJ piece about swing in US states</a>, we decided to try to flip the coordinates of a rather standard line chart, so to display it vertically.</p><p>We decided to call them <em>Snakey charts</em>. And here&rsquo;s <a href=https://bl.ocks.org/basilesimon/e72a435920fffaf2f88a74790e076320>an implementation of them in D3.js</a>.</p><p>Oh, and that was also the first time the Times played with <a href=http://1wheel.github.io/swoopy-drag/>annotations</a>. Unconvinced by the traditional bendy arrows, the designers asked us to go for straight lines, with a bubble at the top. Which apprently looks more Times-y.</p><p><em>(Apologies for the Times fonts being lost in the bl.ock&mldr;)</em></p><hr><h3 id=treemaps>Treemaps</h3><div style=display:flex><img src=assets/TransferWindow4.png height=400></img>

I must say the Times colour palette produced decent looking results.</p><style>img{border:1px solid #ddd;margin:0 auto}</style></content><p></p></article></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo Ê•â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê” Bear</a></footer></body></html>
