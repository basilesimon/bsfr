A node backend and a modular, reactive front page visualising the UK general election results, as they happened. For Reuters Graphics.
Unfortunately, this page was deleted from the internet.

Front end: the results page
The page was built to be modular, i.e. to work this way:

clients must be able to pick and choose which graphics they want, from one of them to all of them,
there is only one repository of code I update and push out to clients.

So the main app itself is broken down into sections which are totally independent from one another."><meta name=keywords content="portfolio,viz,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-general-election-2019-britain/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="ðŸ‘‹ hi, Iâ€™m basile"><meta property="og:title" content="Portfolio case study: Reuters' 2019 general election results page"><meta property="og:description" content="A node backend and a modular, reactive front page visualising the UK general election results, as they happened.

I think The Economist did a chart like this just before the election (if it was you, please email me a link :)).</p><p>I wanted to show the swing and who picked up seats from whom, but we weren&rsquo;t sure how the night was going to play out, and it would have looked very empty for a while. So this was done live and added as a hot commit overnight. And I&rsquo;m quite pleased (in a non-political way) about how well it shows Labour losing seats to quite literally everyone.</p><p><img src=assets/ge2019-ternaries.png alt="Screenshot of the GE2019 ternary charts"></p><div style=margin-top:70px></div><p>And finally, the classic barcode references, which I think do a decent job of conveying the general sense of distribution (and outliers) as well as the general picture.</p><p><img src=assets/ge2019-misc.png alt="Screenshot of miscellaneous bits of the GE2019 page"></p><hr><h2 id=backend>Backend</h2><p>The backend I put together was two-fold:</p><ul><li>A <code>bash</code> scraper polled the PA&rsquo;s FTP server for data they&rsquo;d put out (yes you read this right: FTP) and would mirror and version this data to our <code>S3</code> buckets,</li><li>A <code>node</code> app would then poll these buckets and take it from there.</li></ul><p>In this instance, the role of the backend is to build up, from all the XML files dropped by the PA, a JSON-like representation of the election results as they currently stand.</p><p>There are quite a few hoops to jump through and hurdles to clear, such as recounts and corrections, and unfortunately this process can be quite manual (e.g. file names) or edge cases (e.g. the Speaker&rsquo;s constituency is handled differently by different news organisations).</p><hr><h2 id=inception-and-duties>Inception and duties</h2><p>I designed, built and maintained this project, under the careful editing of Simon Scarr.</p><p>We had code reviews and handovers with colleagues in other offices (Bangalore, Singapore, New York City) in case I&rsquo;d be incapacitated, or if I needed a rest overnight.</p></content><p><a href=https://basilesimon.fr/tags/portfolio/>#Portfolio</a>
