This wasn&rsquo;t just any mock trial; it was a specialised training session for British barristers focused on the authentication of open-source intelligence (OSINT) and the emerging <a href="https://c2pa.org/?ref=basilesimon.fr">C2PA</a> standard.</p>
<p>The goal was to see how these new forms of digital evidence would be practically interrogated by practitioners. After having worked with <a href="https://www.trueproject.co.uk/?ref=basilesimon.fr">the TRUE Project</a> and the Institute for International Legal and Advocacy Training (IILAT) on designing elements of the training material, I was invited to get in the witness box myself and provide expert witness testimony.</p>
<h3 id="the-case">The case</h3>
<p>Our fictional case centered on a war crime in Yemen, where a fighter pilot was accused of a &ldquo;double-tap&rdquo; airstrike. For the purposes of the workshop, the prosecution&rsquo;s case was built on OSINT – though in a real-life setting, there would be more evidence of other kinds, e.g. witness testimony, however.</p>
<p>For the first time in a setting like this, we introduced C2PA metadata as supporting evidence. This metadata came from a C2PA-compatible camera (a <a href="https://www.sony.eu/presscentre/sony-delivers-highly-anticipated-firmware-updates-including-c2pa-compliancy-and-ensuring-authenticity-of-images">Sony Alpha 7 IV</a>). Secondly, there was a second set of attestations: what seemed to be verifications from an investigative journalism collective, added to the same video which we found on TikTok. My role was to present and defend the prosecution&rsquo;s expert report, which detailed how the evidence was collected and verified.</p>
<p><img src="assets/S7V1-verifier.png" alt="">
What the video in question might have looked like in the Content Credentials Verifier tool</p>
<p>It was fascinating to see how skilled barristers, with little to no background in digital forensics, approached this new-to-them type of evidence. They were sharp, methodical, and their line of questioning really put the technology to the test. The experience underscored a few key things for me.</p>
<p>First, the absolute necessity of intellectual honesty for an expert witness. Your primary duty is to the court, to present the facts as clearly and truthfully as possible, regardless of who hired you. Second, the importance of clear communication. I found myself relying on analogies to explain complex technical concepts, avoiding jargon wherever possible. It’s a challenge to bridge the gap between the worlds of technology and law, but it&rsquo;s a crucial one to overcome.</p>
<p>While the training was a success, I did feel we got a bit bogged down in some of the more basic technical details, like the removal of C2PA data from a file. This prevented us from diving deeper into some of the more nuanced and complex aspects of C2PA verification that I was hoping to explore. For future trainings, I think a more interactive and collaborative format would be beneficial. It would allow us to work together to establish best practices for presenting and interrogating this kind of evidence.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, the onus is on me to write a different expert report, which would assist the examination in really getting to the nitty-gritty, and to the actual claims we might derive from provenance metadata!</p>
<p>This experience was a powerful reminder that as technology continues to evolve, so too must our legal frameworks and practices. The C2PA standard has the potential to bring a new level of transparency and trust to digital evidence, but it also presents new challenges. It&rsquo;s only through cross-disciplinary collaboration between technologists and legal professionals that we can ensure these new tools are used responsibly and effectively in the pursuit of justice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful to have been a part of this training and to the many individuals and organisations that made it possible. It was another step forward in my journey to becoming an expert witness and a valuable learning experience that I will carry with me.</p>

<p>As someone working at the intersection of these technologies through <a href="https://starlinglab.org">Starling Lab</a>&rsquo;s partnerships with newsrooms and legal accountability projects, I&rsquo;ve witnessed firsthand how quickly this space moves – one example being the <a href="https://cawg.io?ref=basilesimon.fr">Creator Assertions Working Group</a> (CAWG) which joined the Decentralized Identity Foundation, adding another layer of complexity to an already rich technical landscape.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, C2PA adoption is expanding with real implementations like <a href="https://authenticity.sony.net/camera/en-us?ref=basilesimon.fr">Sony&rsquo;s</a> and <a href="https://leica-camera.com/en-int/photography/content-credentials?ref=basilesimon.fr">Leica&rsquo;s</a>, as well as the recently-launched <a href="https://petapixel.com/2025/08/20/google-pixel-10-series-hands-on-whats-new-for-photographers?ref=basilesimon.fr">Pixel 10 from Google</a> – all producing Content Credentials for the photographs they take.</p>
<p>The challenge isn&rsquo;t just technical – it is in fact informational. With C2PA technical working groups meeting regularly, CAWG operating under new governance structures, and CAI fostering quarterly community events spanning topics from deepfakes to photojournalism, <strong>the sheer volume of signal across mailing lists, GitHub repositories, meeting minutes, and specifications makes comprehensive monitoring a significant undertaking.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is why I&rsquo;m reaching out to the community for help.</strong> At Starling Lab, we&rsquo;ve seen how these technologies translate into real-world impact through our journalism fellowships and authentication frameworks, but we know there are countless other developments happening across member organizations that deserve broader visibility.</p>
<p><strong>A community publication could serve as a valuable aggregation point</strong>, helping practitioners, researchers, and industry members stay informed about everything from new CAWG identity assertion specifications to emerging industry adoptions. But first, we need to map the information landscape effectively.</p>
<p>Your input on key sources – whether working group minutes, critical GitHub repositories, or essential mailing list – —will help determine the scope and approach for this monitoring effort. Together, we can create a resource that serves this fast-growing community&rsquo;s need for clear, consolidated information about where content authenticity is heading.</p>

My talk provides a high-level overview of the work conducted over the past year by the whole team at the <a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/">Starling Lab for Data Integrity</a> (co-founded and established at Stanford University and the University of Southern California).</p>
<p>In this talk called “Web Archives as Evidence”, I presented our Authenticated Attributes (AA) prototypes to an audience of archivists and web archiving professionals, many of them from national libraries.</p>
<p>Edit July 1: 🎥 The video is now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFEvZx96W98">available on Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>The central proposition of AA is to be a database of authenticated key-value metadata pairs – much like a spreadsheet, but with independent and verifiable provenance for every cell. Also, it’s peer-to-peer replicated, and folks can subscribe to this feed of strong metadata.</p>
<p>AA is built on <a href="https://github.com/holepunchto/hypercore">Hypercore</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperbee">Hyperbee</a>, which work together to make sharing and finding information easy, fast, and secure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hypercore is a distributed append-only log that forms the foundation of a peer-to-peer network. It enables the creation of efficient and cryptographically-secure data structures that can be shared and synchronized across multiple devices. This technology enables advanced features like hole-punching, enhancing connectivity even in difficult or firewalled network environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hyperbee is a distributed B-tree database layered on top of Hypercore, designed to store and retrieve key-value pairs with high efficiency. Think of it as an advanced filing system where information is systematically organised, making it easy to locate specific data quickly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am honored to be part of a session chaired by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghanlyon">Meghan Lyon</a> from the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>. Meghan has been actively involved in the IIPC community, chairing sessions at previous conferences, including the Web Archiving Conference in Paris in 2024, which I also attended.</p>
<p><a href="https://netpreserve.org/">The IIPC, established in 2003</a>, is a global organization dedicated to acquiring, preserving, and making accessible knowledge and information from the Internet for future generations.

The work has (hopefully!) led me toward expert witness roles, and I&rsquo;m continuing the collaboration with IILAT on a second round of training at the Inner Temple in July 2025.</p>
<h4 id="from-behind-the-scenes-to-the-witness-stand">From Behind the Scenes to&hellip; the Witness Stand?</h4>
<p>Yvonne McDermott, from Swansea University and the TRUE Project, asked me to participate to the development of their September 2024 advocacy training, to take place at IILAT in The Hague. I pitched to the design of their comprehensive scenario, and to competing expert analyses designed to stress-test how participant lawyers might interrogate digital evidence in an era of deepfakes, AI-generated content, and sophisticated misinformation campaigns. I notably focused on emerging standards like C2PA and their implications for both prosecution and defence arguments.</p>
<h4 id="the-legal-arguments-i-wanted-to-test-with-c2pa-and-provenance-metadata">The Legal Arguments I Wanted to Test with C2PA and Provenance Metadata</h4>
<p>I felt participants should grapple with emerging technical standards like the <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)</a>. Through the work of a fictional &ldquo;Truth Crews&rdquo; organisation, who provided verification in a classic OSI / user-generated evidence scenario, I explored both the promise and the peril of cryptographically signed metadata.</p>
<p>The provenance question, asked about a C2PA example, proved particularly complex. The emerging standard promises to revolutionise digital evidence by embedding cryptographically signed metadata that can trace a piece of content from creation through every modification. On one hand, C2PA might offer unprecedented transparency: prosecutors could present media with verifiable chains of custody, timestamps that can&rsquo;t be easily manipulated, and attestations from trusted organisations. On its face, all sounds great, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the defence concerns are equally compelling: the very legitimacy that C2PA provides could become a weapon. When content bears the digital signatures of reputable software like Adobe&rsquo;s or verification from established organisations, courts might give it undue weight – even when the underlying content itself remains unverified. The green checkmarks and corporate logos could create what I termed a &ldquo;veneer of legitimacy&rdquo; that makes sophisticated forgeries more convincing than crude ones ever were.</p>
<p>I found myself grappling with these very questions: How do we distinguish between reliable open source investigation and proper forensic examination? When does corroboration become meaningless in the face of scale manipulation? Do emerging verification technologies change the game entirely?</p>
<h4 id="building-bridges-between-technology-and-justice">Building Bridges Between Technology and Justice</h4>
<p>On the need for this dual role – expert witness and training designer –, I&rsquo;ll report back after engaging with the other trainers and participants in July. I certainly think that there&rsquo;s a need for professionals who can translate complex technical concepts for legal audiences while understanding the practical constraints and requirements of judicial proceedings and digital investigations. But being in this situation, I would think that, wouldn&rsquo;t I.</p>
<p>So I hope that the collaboration between Starling Lab, TRUE Project, IILAT, and institutions like the Inner Temple represents exactly the kind of cross-disciplinary work we need more of. By bringing together technologists, legal practitioners, and judicial institutions, we&rsquo;re building the expertise necessary to navigate an increasingly complex evidence landscape.</p>

<p>I contributed a chapter: <em>“Coding with data in the newsroom”</em>, which you&rsquo;ll find in the second section, <em>“Working with data”</em>, nicely tucked between Barbara Maseda&rsquo;s <em>“Text as data: finding stories in text collections”</em> 😎 and Sam Leon&rsquo;s <em>“Accounting for methods: spreadsheets, scripts and programming notebooks.”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>That chapter is meant as a primer to anyone considering dipping their toes into programming in a newsroom context. I&rsquo;ve worked at the BBC (an international broadcaster), The Times (a mainstream newspaper) and Reuters (an international wire agency) and it bears repeating:</p>
<p><strong>newsrooms aren&rsquo;t tech companies.</strong></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re weird, dysfunctional, traditional places.</p>
<p>I wanted to point out three aspects of working with programming techniques and with interrogating data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Time to learn</li>
<li>Working with deadlines</li>
<li>Reviewing code</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="you-need-time-to-learn-and-plenty-of-it">You need time to learn, and plenty of it</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a great deal of that, and we&rsquo;re probably not all equal before how much slack we&rsquo;re given on the job for dabbling and self-learning.</p>

<p>Not delivering on time is a cardinal sin in our profession, and we must also account for last-minute tweaks, data questions, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“One challenge for beginners is slowdown caused by learning a new way to work. When setting off to do something new, particularly in the beginning of your learning, make sure you leave yourself enough time to be able to complete your task with a tool you know (e.g., spreadsheet).”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I did, and I still include this &ldquo;scrap that let&rsquo;s do it simpler&rdquo; time in my budgets.</p>
<p>But I also think there is valuable inspiration to draw on from software engineering work. We may not need a Jira instance, but smaller tools helping us keep track of our progress as well as budgeting an MVP and successive, iterative improvements are good ideas for technical profiles in newsrooms too.</p>
<h2 id="code-reviews-and-data-audits-are-cruise-control-for-safe">Code reviews and data audits are cruise control for safe</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Data journalists (&hellip;) often work on their own, either because they don’t have colleagues, because there are no peer-review systems in place or because there is no one with the right skills to review their code.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Internal quality control mechanisms can therefore become a luxury that only a few data journalism teams can afford (there are no sub-editors for coding!). The cost of not having such control is potential bugs left unattended, sub-optimal performance or, worst of all, errors left unseen.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suffered from this, and I still can think of many colleagues who don&rsquo;t have easy access to some of the stellar colleagues I had and whom I learned so much.</p>

<hr>
<p>Every day, dedicated investigative journalists and human rights monitors scour the Web in search of proof of abuse, wrongdoing, and crime. The material they gather is at risk of being ruled inadmissible and dismissed out of hand in court.</p>
<p>Ahead of verification and authenticity concerns, preserving this material appropriately is a difficult problem drawing on several technically-advanced fields: from the high standards of the maintenance of the chain of custody to the cost of storage, the need for accessibility and availability of the material years into the future, the challenges are considerable – and a lot for one organisation to take on.</p>
<p>The Digital Evidence Toolkit is an advocacy project bringing together scholars, experts, practitioners and activists.</p>

<p>The project came to be as a backburner piece for my contribution to the Europe, Middle East and Africa Reuters file: a kind of backgrounder, explainer story we could mention and push out again every once in a while.</p>
<p>The central question was whether we could back up the feeling Lobby reporters had that there were several groups of Tories, so-called &ldquo;tribes,&rdquo; with different attitudes to Brexit — while Labour parliamentarians were relatively united in pushing back against Theresa May&rsquo;s deal.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-EU-LEADER/010092Q33KW/index.html">The main Reuters Graphics story</a></strong> studied 12 key votes on amendments to the deal, which were fascinating as they reprensented new ideas from parliamentarians about what to do about Brexit.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://blog.basilesimon.fr/2019/10/06/brexit-machine-learning/">I also published a follow-up looking at 238 votes</a></strong> and feeding the records to a machine learning algorithm, which as it was a lot more speculative was not Reuters&rsquo; cup of tea.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In the night of Nov 9 to 10, 1938, Nazi Germany&rsquo;s SA forces carried out a devastating pogrom. The event came to be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht"><em>Kristallnacht</em>, &ldquo;The Night of Broken Glass.&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>Last week, as I walked in the street in the evening I noticed that some of the brass plques had candles and roses next to them, a silent and unattended vigil in the street. It was in remeberance of Kristallnacht. The picture below is mine:</p>
<p><img src="assets/stolpersteine.jpg" alt="picture of a Stolperstein in the street"></p>
<p>These plaques are Stolpersteine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A Stolperstein (pronounced [ˈʃtɔlpɐˌʃtaɪn]; literally &ldquo;stumbling stone&rdquo;, metaphorically a &ldquo;stumbling block&rdquo;) is a sett-size, ten-centimetre (3.9 in) concrete cube bearing a brass plate inscribed with the name and life dates of victims of Nazi extermination or persecution.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Today, Stolpersteine are being realized for Jews, Sinti and Roma, people from the political or religious resistance, victims of the &ldquo;euthanasia&rdquo; murders, homosexuals, Jehovahs Witnesses and for people who were persecuted for being declared to be &ldquo;asocial&rdquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;(It is a) project created by Gunter Demnig for honoring victims of National Socialism&rdquo;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein">(Wikipedia)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-why-is-the-data-so-different">So why is the data so different?</h2>
<p>These are two public records of the location and number of Berlin&rsquo;s Stolpersteine:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314003">Wikidata database</a>,</li>
<li>and another database referenced in the <a href="daten.berlin.de">daten.berlin.de</a> catalogue, is the dataset produced by <a href="https://stolpersteine-berlin.de">stolpersteine-berlin.de</a> – which describes itself as &ldquo;(a) liaison office between the artist Gunter Demnig together with his team and the local Stolperstein-groups.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>There are only about <strong>1,780 Wikidata records</strong> in Berlin, and they&rsquo;re overwhelmingly in the west of the city. Stolpersteine-berlin, on the other hand, has <strong>3,307 records</strong>, many of them including several family members.</p>
<p>The Wikidata dataset has however the merit of spanning not only all of Germany, but also all of Europe:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="584" frameborder="0"
  src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@basilesimon/berlin-stolpersteine?cell=viz"></iframe>
<p>Could the second dataset, good enough to be referenced by the Berlin open data initiative, be added to the Wikidata records, I wonder?</p>

<p><strong>A node backend and a modular, reactive front page visualising the UK general election results, as they happened. For Reuters Graphics.</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this page was deleted from the internet.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="front-end-the-results-page">Front end: the results page</h2>
<p>The page was built to be modular, i.e. to work this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>clients must be able to pick and choose which graphics they want, from one of them to all of them,</li>
<li>there is only one repository of code I update and push out to clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the main app itself is broken down into sections which are totally independent from one another.</p>
<p>The root of the main app, which all clients will run, is then quite minimal in terms of data processing, as it does not need to worry about what kind of data wrangling the modular sections downstream require.</p>

For the results map, we weren&rsquo;t quite ready to commit to cartogram only, for fear that our very international audience wouldn&rsquo;t quite recognise the country.</p>
<p>I felt it was an important thing to include, though, since urban/rural voting patterns are quite different in the UK, and Labour&rsquo;s importance is visually underwhelming otherwise.</p>
<p>So I built both, and I&rsquo;m particularly proud of I managed to run 650 <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-transition#transition_attrTween">tween interpolators</a> at the same time to transition between the two states. <a href="https://github.com/veltman/flubber">Noah, thanks for Flubber</a> once again!</p>

<p><strong>Visualising change and who won from whom</strong><br>
I&rsquo;m no stranger to ternary plots, which allow to plot three dimensions in an Euclidean space, in 2D. I think The Economist did a chart like this just before the election (if it was you, please email me a link :)).</p>
<p>I wanted to show the swing and who picked up seats from whom, but we weren&rsquo;t sure how the night was going to play out, and it would have looked very empty for a while. So this was done live and added as a hot commit overnight. And I&rsquo;m quite pleased (in a non-political way) about how well it shows Labour losing seats to quite literally everyone.</p>
<p><img src="assets/ge2019-ternaries.png" alt="Screenshot of the GE2019 ternary charts"></p>
<div style="margin-top: 70px"></div>
<p>And finally, the classic barcode references, which I think do a decent job of conveying the general sense of distribution (and outliers) as well as the general picture.</p>
<p><img src="assets/ge2019-misc.png" alt="Screenshot of miscellaneous bits of the GE2019 page"></p>

<h2 id="backend">Backend</h2>
<p>The backend I put together was two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>bash</code> scraper polled the PA&rsquo;s FTP server for data they&rsquo;d put out (yes you read this right: FTP) and would mirror and version this data to our <code>S3</code> buckets,</li>
<li>A <code>node</code> app would then poll these buckets and take it from there.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this instance, the role of the backend is to build up, from all the XML files dropped by the PA, a JSON-like representation of the election results as they currently stand.</p>
<p>There are quite a few hoops to jump through and hurdles to clear, such as recounts and corrections, and unfortunately this process can be quite manual (e.g. file names) or edge cases (e.g. the Speaker&rsquo;s constituency is handled differently by different news organisations).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="inception-and-duties">Inception and duties</h2>
<p>I designed, built and maintained this project, under the careful editing of Simon Scarr.</p>
<p>We had code reviews and handovers with colleagues in other offices (Bangalore, Singapore, New York City) in case I&rsquo;d be incapacitated, or if I needed a rest overnight.</p>

<p>I recently had to complete a technical test for a role I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>The task: from <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/oil-gas-and-mining/chevron-stop-funding-racism/">a story out of the Global Witness website</a>, can you come up with an alternative visualisation? <strong>You&rsquo;ve got two hours.</strong></p>
<p>As there were no embed constraints, I figured there was no point in faffing with boilerplate code and scaffolds, so I went down the Observable route to put a chart together.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we need scales-wise:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the y axis, the amount of the individual donations range from 0 to $10,000 &ndash; we&rsquo;ll use a linear scale which domain is mapped to this extent;</li>
<li>On the x axis, we&rsquo;ve got two categories: the donations that pass the NAACP criteria, and those that don&rsquo;t. We cue an ordinal scale which domain are these values;</li>
<li>A simple colour scale;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>But as donation amounts overlap each other, so do our circles. Here they are, with a small increasing offset to show this banding effect:</p>
<p><img src="assets/beeswarm-overlap.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Comes the force layout to the rescue, adding some simulated entropy to the x/y coordinates of our circles and allowing us to appreciate the difference in scale between the two columns.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">const</span> simulation <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> d3

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  .force(<span style="color:#d14">&#39;x&#39;</span>, d3.forceX(d =&gt; x(d.category)).strength(<span style="color:#099">0.2</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  .force(<span style="color:#d14">&#39;y&#39;</span>, d3.forceY(d =&gt; y(<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">+</span>d.donationUSD)).strength(<span style="color:#099">1</span>))

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  .alphaDecay(<span style="color:#099">0</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  .alpha(<span style="color:#099">0.3</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  .stop();
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We apply three forces to our simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>One <strong>on the x axis</strong>, so our circles bucket into our two categories. We specify a weak <code>.strength()</code> so they spread out horizontally rather than vertically (and thus are more truthful to the precise donation amounts);</li>
<li>One <strong>on the y axis</strong>, where in this case the <code>.strength()</code> is far greater to squeeze them further, as seen above;</li>
<li>A <strong>collision force</strong> which repels the circles from each other, so as to spread them apart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here they are, showing the influence of x and y&rsquo;s <code>.strength()</code>:</p>

<p><strong>An interactive map of natural gas infrastructure in the EU, built with Svelte and d3, for Global Witness.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="some-context">Some context</h3>
<p>The EU has a rule in place to regulate which electricity and fossil fuel projects it will financially support. These projects include the terminals and pipelines used to import and transport fossil gas – sometimes referred to as natural gas. Under this regulation, selected gas projects get fast-track approval and access to billions in public subsidies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a law called TEN-E Regulation.</p>
<p>And it has a problem: it gifts remarkable power over EU policy to an obscure cadre of gas companies called the <em>European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas</em>, or ENTSOG. Under the law, ENTSOG companies help the EU predict how much gas Europe needs and helps the Commission decide what gas infrastructure projects to support.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict of interest? Legal but non-virtuous circle?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>For their campaign, Global Witness wanted to visualise all the gas projects the EU has subsidised, and how much projects backed by these ENTSOG companies have received.</strong></p>
<h3 id="project-course">Project course</h3>
<p>From a rough interactive map prototype, I pitched a stack proposal and a five-day contract, which I worked over three or four weeks.</p>
<p>I focused on the complex interactivity first, bringing in styles from GW&rsquo;s guidelines as we went along. We kept the show on track with frequent reviews, which were helpful but greatly helped by the fact that we were all on the same page and that my proposals and initiative seemed to be appreciated.</p>
<p>We kept some on-call hours for publication day, but it all went smoothly.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="visual-density-and-jargon">Visual density and jargon</h3>
<p>The campaign is aimed at European lawmakers or persons of influence. Folks who know about a particular country, or particular infrastructure projects, and who <em>will</em> want to know the precise names and amounts.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re getting away with this kind of rather busy display, which has the merit of displaying <em>a lot</em> of information, though it&rsquo;s rather wordy:</p>
<p><img src="assets/gw-bulgaria.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="link-in-place">Link in place</h3>
<p>Readers can link to a specific country, as well as tweet some pre-defined patterns of copy which are also country-specific. Here again, we&rsquo;re helping the MEP tweet out their outrage about projects in their country.</p>
<h3 id="explorable-clickable-hoverable">Explorable, clickable, hoverable</h3>
<p>This is where reactive programming patterns really help:</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> to set up a central, app-wide source of truth, which the different components and views can access, and sometimes edit.</p>
<p>This allows us to have different behaviours at different moments. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>When looking at the European level, we don&rsquo;t highlight and can&rsquo;t click the individual projects ; but we can do so at the country level.</li>
<li>We display different data depending on the country highlighted. For the Trans Adriatic Pipeline, a Belgian MEP will see the funding of Belgian ENTSOG companies ; an Italian will see their side of the projects, and so on.</li>
</ul>

To put it lightly, it has become difficult to explain, or simply to fathom what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>
<p>A few months ago I looked at <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-EU-LEADER/010092Q33KW/index.html">the rift splitting the Conservative Party</a>, but the topic kept nagging me.</p>
<p><a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-EU-LEADER/010092Q33KW/index.html"><img src="assets/brexit-split.png" style="width: 50%; margin: auto;"></img></a></p>
<p>Obviously the &ldquo;indicative votes&rdquo; were a great tool to identify the <a href="https://ig.ft.com/brexit-tory-tribes/">Brexit &ldquo;tribes,&rdquo;</a> as they represented such varied opinions, allowing us to build a mental picture of the different kinds of Brexit MPs could support.</p>
<p>But paying close attention to British politics for a while introduces a certain perception bias, whereby we see some MPs as more or less extreme based on our impressions shaped over a few months discusssing the topic — the quite questionable data we gathered by reading the news.</p>
<p>So here are my questions:</p>
<p><em><strong>What about the long-term, more latent allegiances MPs might hold?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Could we do without our &ldquo;Brexit goggles&rdquo; and look at a more impartial, objective picture of our House of Commons?</strong></em></p>
<p>To find out, I fed a number of House of Commons Brexit-related votes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding"><code>t-SNE</code>, a machine learning discovery algorithm</a>. The result is below:</p>

<p>Note the clustering of Brexiteers at the top of the plot, including Labour&rsquo;s Kate Hoey, the DUP, and Boris Johnson&rsquo;s cabinet.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Conservative cloud are the more moderate MPs and Theresa May&rsquo;s cabinet. Former prime minister Ken Clarke is placed close to Sir Oliver Letwin (author of prominent amendments allowing the House to wrestle control from the government) and Dr Philip Lee, who defected to the Lib Dems.</p>
<p>Kit Malthouse, author of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/29/the-malthouse-compromise-everything-you-need-to-know-brexit-vote">&ldquo;Malthouse compromise&rdquo;</a> which gathered support from both sides of the Conservative benches, is in the middle.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-word-on-the-data">A word on the data</h3>
<p>The dataset is comprised of 238 votes, including amendments and draft bills, &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; and &ldquo;indicative&rdquo; votes (on Theresa May&rsquo;s deal and on a range of freely-submitted, blue-sky-thinking options respectivelly), as well as procedural votes and motions (such as Sir Oliver Letwin&rsquo;s two successes at wrestling control of parliamentary agenda away from the executive branch).</p>
<p>These votes took place between September 2017 and September 2019, and I must thank the <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/">Institute for Government</a>, who have provided the overwhelming majority of this research labelling Brexit-related votes from two years&rsquo; worth of votes.</p>
<p>As for the previous Reuters piece, I scraped the <a href="http://www.data.parliament.uk/">Parliament API</a> to obtain each vote cast by each MP in each House of Commons vote.</p>
<p>The <code>t-SNE</code> algorithm took into account how MPs voted (in favour or against a bill) and whether they voted at all (MPs are not bound to cast their vote, and some occasionally abstain).</p>
<p>These numerous variables were reduced by the algorithm to two dimensions for visualisations (<em>x</em> and <em>y</em>). Contrary to a principal component analysis (see <em>The Economist</em> piece below), it is not possible to say what <code>t-SNE</code> has <em>seen</em> (so to speak) in a dataset.</p>

<p>[https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=status][https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=status]</p>
<p>This is the first release of IBTrACS version 04. It is updated weekly.<br>
Release date: March 2019</p>
<p>New features (improvements from v03):</p>
<ul>
<li>Best track data updated daily and contain provisional tracks of recent storms.</li>
<li>Reduced formats - Version 4 is available in 3 formats (netCDF, CSV, shapefiles)</li>
<li>Consistent formats - The data presented in each format is completely interconsistent (identical).</li>
<li>More parameters - More parameters provided by the agencies are provided in IBTrACS</li>
<li>Basin assignment - Any system occuring in a basin is included in that basin file (in version 3, the storm was only included in the basin in which it had its genesis)</li>

<h3 id="the-tractatus-logico-philosophicus-viewed-as-a-phylogenetic-tree">The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus viewed as a phylogenetic tree</h3>
<p>Inspired by this, I&rsquo;ve had a look at Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico Philosophicus</a> (available on <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5740">Project Gutenberg</a>), which is presented as hierachically numbered statements and sub-statements.</p>
<p>We start by scraping the book into a dataframe with one row per statement:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We then generate our cluster analysis based on the distance between the columns of <code>df</code>, hoping that the hierachical numbering of statements will yield something interesting.</p>
<p>We adopt the <code>single</code> method, described like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>single linkage</em> method (which is closely related to the minimal spanning tree) adopts a ‘friends of friends’ clustering strategy</p>

<p>The diagrams above show how our clusters have correctly grouped together the hierachical statements of the <em>Tractatus</em>.</p>
<p>From Mike Bostock&rsquo;s <a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/tree-of-life">Tree of Life</a> helped by Jason Davies&rsquo; work <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/newick.js">parsing a Newick text file format</a> (standard in tree representations) in Javascript, I re-implemented the above with <code>d3-jetpack</code> and ES6: <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/basilesimon/66db4338c15099f6e8d62f236db2ef2d">https://bl.ocks.org/basilesimon/66db4338c15099f6e8d62f236db2ef2d</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting chart is at the top of this page.</p>
<p>I love how simple the result looks and how little we end up knowing about the book itself. The only thinkg I&rsquo;ll let you in the final, chapter seven put-down of this book about language, facts and truths of the world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Precisely what I didn&rsquo;t do in this blog about phylogenetics and a book I never finished.</p>

<p>But behold, we can also get data straight from Open Street Map thanks to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmdata/vignettes/osmdata.html">osmdata</a>. The syntax is relatively concise and OSM&rsquo;s web interface allows you to query features directly from there:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/4f3440eea455f9f94ce42e46444cb838.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>In our example, we grab all the parks in London and them use <code>geom_sf()</code> to represent both the <code>polygons</code> and <code>multipolygons</code> (the <code>osmdata</code>object <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmdata/vignettes/osmdata.html#3_the_osmdata_object">has plenty inside it</a>). We need both polygons and multipolygons because, according to the OSM wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any area that is more complex than that (e.g., because its outline consists of several ways joined together, or because the area consists of multiple disjunct parts, or has holes) requires a <em>multipolygon</em> relation.</p>

<p>Well, we&rsquo;re almost there. For this first draft I stopped at the map above, exported an SVG and sent that to the lab for printing.</p>
<p>There is no limit to how much you can play with this data. One thing that really struck me was how imprecise my GPS tracking devices were in the City of London (despite being prosumer equipment). Below is a representation of one year of data, on which I&rsquo;ve overlaid the OSM paths corresponding to the streets around Bishopsgate, Cheapside, Monument, Cannon Street, Aldgate, Smithfields, London Bridge and Blackfriars.</p>

<p>Since Clément has done some good work compiling this dataset, we only need to loop over all GPX files we can find in the directories. We&rsquo;ve kept <code>data@time</code> to have a look at when the journeys happened.</p>
<p>Oh, and we need to assign a <code>group</code> variable to each unique path in order to be able to separate them when visualising. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll end up with one single uninterrupted line.</p>

<p>In the output SVG file, the country boundaries and the tracks are in separate <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> groups, and very easy to isolate. This makes plotting the result one group after the other, with two different pens, very easy. There&rsquo;s a video of the plotting below.</p>

<p>The object of our study here is a series of tracks followed by each storm. Representing tracks as lines feels natural.
As our data comes as a list of points, we need to group together all the points that represent one storm. Were we studying say, the winds, we would run something like this, grouping our points by storm unique ID.</p>

<h1 id="storms-by-year-and-month">Storms by year and month</h1>
<p>Now who doesn&rsquo;t like a good facetting? That&rsquo;s how I fell in love with <code>ggplot</code> in the first place. We can easily extract dates from our data in order to prepare for different facetting opportunities.</p>
<p>Facetting by year allows us to visually (and relatively unreliably) compare years against each other. Doing the same operation by month will show when do typhoons mostly hit in the Pacific. (Edit December 2018: we now use <code>lubridate</code> functions to do so.)</p>

<h2 id="the-media-folks">The media folks</h2>
<p>Good to see media organisations were well represented, and that some great work keeps coming out and pushing the field. Interestingly though, it seems that the admiration of the NYT is not confined to interactive journalists!</p>
<p>There were a fair few journalist types at OpenVis, in addition to those who occasionally work for publications. But there were many, many colleagues in attendance, which made for fun gossiping in the evening.</p>
<p>And as far as the London media dataviz scene in concerned, more soon…</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning">Machine learning</h2>
<p>t-SNE and image classification were all the rage. Great data work is alive and well, but it seemed to be always somehow linked to Big Tech.</p>
<h2 id="performance-in-the-browser">Performance in the browser</h2>
<p>No fewer than two talks were solely devoted to 3D and to animating heavy models with either thousands of points or complex rasters and textures. WebGL and Canvas are still where the money is, but the challenge remains for lower-performance smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="arvr">AR/VR</h2>
<p>Coincidentally, little was said about AR and VR. For which I&rsquo;m not tremendously sad.</p>
<h2 id="a-shared-set-of-practices">A shared set of practices?</h2>
<p>As one of the speakers said, &ldquo;we should get ourselves some cool acronyms to describe our methods too.&rdquo; Are data scientists still suffering from a lack of recognition?</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>Open source is pretty much ruling here. I say <span class="underline">almost</span> because Tableau&rsquo;s market cap still is $7.6b as of May 2018.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part happy, part disappointed we weren&rsquo;t put through hours of live coding or technical demos. Only Jo Wood, from City University, presented a tool. The two-day conference was however followed by a day of workshops - which I sadly could not attend. Shame I missed the opportunity to have my typos spotted by Mike Bostock.</p>
<h2 id="various-levels-of-technicality">Various levels of technicality</h2>
<p>In turn, the speakers took us from advanced machine learning algorithms applied to solving their viz issues to artsy design-led thinking and Illustrator; from heavy statistics to gif-making; and from theoretical discussions about how to think about &ldquo;the AR canvas&rdquo; to common numerical and statistical fallacies.</p>
<p>Regardless of our background and experience, there was enough of everything for everyone in the room.</p>
<h2 id="great-scheduling">Great scheduling</h2>
<p>Hat-tip to the committee once again for crafting such a splendid schedule. Presentations echoed each other, and at times replied to one another. The best example was Federica Fragapane taking the stage following Steven Franconeri: she is such an incredible artist and embodies <a href="https://medium.com/visualizing-the-field/the-7-kinds-of-data-visualization-people-9964e80443a7">&ldquo;The Italians&rdquo;</a> category, as per Elijah Meeks and Susie Lu&rsquo;s definition. Her talk about visual narratives for empathy was visually rich, and her work felt like the polar opposite of Steven&rsquo;s demonstration, an hour earlier, of how our brain takes such a long time to read visualisations, colours, and patterns.</p>
<p>A fantastic discussion that subconsciously happened thanks to scheduling mastery.</p>
<hr>
<p>All this to say that I can&rsquo;t wait for the 2019 edition of OpenVis! Thank you again to the committee and volunteers for planning and running such a great event.</p>

No more lectures planned until next year. A few weeks to wait while the students complete their final projects and frantically email me questions.</p>
<p>This year was quite different from the last one. Here&rsquo;s what we covered in the &ldquo;Advanced Data and Coding&rdquo; module, part of City University&rsquo;s Interactive Journalism MA.</p>
<h2 id="module-outline">Module outline</h2>
<p>We started off by talking about the web and the HTML-CSS-Javascript triangle. We ran through some exercises together, emphasising the concept of the DOM and how these three languages interact with the DOM through its API.</p>
<p>We moved on fairly quickly to file formats and to an introduction to Python through the Jupyter Notebook. In this graphical environment and armed with some syntax basics we briefly looked at Pandas for exploratory analysis then touched on web scraping. I ended up adding a session to the Python cocktail to introduce the concept of REST APIs, taking Twitter as an example.</p>
<p>The core of the module was an introduction to R through the prism of the tidyverse. We scraped, cleaned and plotted data for several sessions - learning by running into the same problems over and over again until they became easy things to solve.</p>
<p>Despite losing a bit of time due to oral presentations in class, we managed to learn how to do bits of more advanced data analysis and linear regressions.</p>
<p>Finally, we wrapped up the teaching with an overview of charting in Javascript and of d3, obviously. Aside from running through Mike Bostock&rsquo;s <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a bar chart,&rdquo;</a> we did not spend much time on d3, moving on swiftly to using Highcharts and cooking up website prototypes based on a collection of Bootstrap resources I gathered in a <a href="https://github.com/basilesimon/interactive-journalism-module/tree/master/website-template">website template</a>.</p>
<p>We followed the formal teaching with three weeks spent talking about the students&rsquo; final projects, solving problems together and hopefully all benefiting from each other&rsquo;s struggles.</p>
<h2 id="some-lessons-learned">Some lessons learned</h2>
<p>There is much more I want to write about this year&rsquo;s module, but for now, I am happy I led two sessions a week instead of splitting the module between two lecturers. This had led last year to an artificial split between front-end and R/Python, when I&rsquo;d rather we look at it as a single pipeline for data journalism.</p>
<p>Teaching both R and Python, however, is still a lot. And it is somehow confusing by the end of the term: we did roughly the same thing in R and Python, so which one should I choose, they ask. I decided to go tidyverse-only and no-d3 this year, and I shall proceed to removing Python from the course next year. Less is more.</p>
<p>Finally, dedicating some time each week to talking about the field and running through the <em>best of the week</em> newsletters seemed to work quite well. One small assessment was an oral presentation about a piece, a technique, or a trend - and I was genuinely very happy with the quality of the research done for this assignment. I also hope my students will be better prepared and more knowledgeable for their job interviews.</p>

<p>Today, we are happy to share the first version of our data visualisation catalogue: a collection of data visualisations created for the Times and Sunday Times, collected together in one place in the hope that what we have learned can be useful to others.</p>
<p>Our goal is to compile and showcase the best of our burgeoning data visualisation work, rather than to offer a taxonomy of visual journalism (the FT’s Visual Vocabulary is a fantastic resource for that).</p>
<p>This collection will also be used internally as a training resource to upskill members of our digital team. From reporters to editors, developers and designers, understanding the correct way to visualise a data set is crucial to enhancing our stories and bringing them to life online.</p>
<p>The catalogue is both a publicly accessible website showing the breadth of our work, and a <a href="https://github.com/times/dataviz-catalogue">Github repository</a> allowing developers to understand how they are built.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="two-audiences">Two audiences?</h2>
<p><a href="https://times.github.io/dataviz-catalogue/">The website is a great starting place</a> for showcasing our work and a resource we intend to grow over time. The website can also be used to <a href="http://nytimes.github.io/svg-crowbar/">crowbar</a> SVGs out for additional Illustrator massage — think of it as a hiring tool and a style guide.</p>
<p>We display only one chart per page to keep things clean, and we’re publishing everything on Github so you can clone the code and see a data visualisation’s evolution there too.</p>
<p><img src="assets/catalogue.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>README files for each type of chart provide handy details about the data format we have implemented. As a growing number of journalists become proficient with basic data manipulation, we wanted to fulfill this requirement directly.</p>
<hr>
<p>Frequent practitioners will notice that the code is kept very simple. This is a purposeful decision, and following conventions and habits (particularly around d3.js). In doing so, we aim to make our code more familiar, and hopefully easier to experiment with.</p>
<p>The only notable exception to what remains common in d3 world is the use of ES6. The elegance of arrow functions, the relatively wide cross-browser support, and the broad adoption of tools like Babel to cater for those browsers that don’t fully support ES6 should convince everyone to make the switch.</p>

&lt;p>For us, well, that means a slight change of plans. Throwing the forward planning stuff away and focusing on the big event to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me, that meant jumping on building our lead graphics for the weeks to come: &lt;strong>the poll of polls.&lt;/strong>

<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://github.com/gka/d3-jetpack"><code>d3-jetpack</code></a> to do some bits in here, and the result will look a tad confusing to those used to the rather standardised d3 code we read on bl.ocks.org every day. That said, passing object of attributes and of camel-cased CSS styles to d3 selections looks rather attractive to me.</p>
<p><code>d3-jetpack</code> is rather brutal in inserting its methods directly onto d3 itself, but if you can live with it, you get this:</p>
<p>Instead of:</p>

<p>Two days ago, many months of hard work by multiple teams in our Technology department came to fruition. At 1am they flipped a switch which added an “s” and a tiny green lock in the address bar when you visit our website, accompanied by a reassuring message: “Secure.”</p>
<p>We moved the Times and Sunday Times domains to HTTPS, and here is why we’re quietly celebrating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a reader of The Times and The Sunday Times, why does this matter?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your traffic and web browsing history is constantly logged by internet service providers (ISPs) under the provisions of the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. Even if you don’t care about intelligence agencies looking at your history, this data is valuable and a premium product, as Americans are realising since President Trump repealed rules that required ISPs to seek and obtain permission from customers to collect and use such data on browsing habits.</p>
<p>HTTPs is a first step in protecting readers against this.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="you-know-its-us">You know it’s us</h3>
<p>HTTPS prevents someone tampering with our journalism before you see it.</p>
<p>When you read us, we want to be sure our words reach you unaltered.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="more-privacy-for-you">More privacy for you</h3>
<p>It is generally easy if you’re connected to a computer network to listen to what’s going on. Think of a coffee shop, the Tube wifi, or your office. What you read says a lot about you, and HTTPS will protect you against eavesdropping.</p>
<p>Our domain (thetimes.co.uk) will still be sent unencrypted on the network, but specific articles or search keywords that would reveal what you’re looking at won’t.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="safer-handling-of-your-information">Safer handling of your information</h3>
<p>We have protected personal details such as your email address, postal address and credit card in this way for years; now all your browsing and reading will be as safe as your login and personal information.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="malware-injection">Malware injection</h3>
<p>Malware and code that could harm your computer, as well as unwanted ads, can be injected by many parties when you look at an unsecured website. For example, free wifi hotspots at airports sell big ad banners they’ll sneakily inject on the websites you’re looking at. Ad spaces can be targeted by hackers to exploit their legitimate placement on trusted websites to inject code directly inside your browser.</p>
<p>Not any more on HTTPS.</p>
<p>With a complex website like ours, containing articles, interactive content and ads from many different systems, this simple switch has taken several months of hard work. But we’re proud to be able to make the web safer for our readers. Later this year, we’ll be building on HTTPS to offer new ways for sources to contact The Times and The Sunday Times in confidence — putting privacy and security at the heart of our journalism.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="better-performance-and-enhanced-functionality">Better performance and enhanced functionality</h3>
<p>With HTTPS we’ve also enabled HTTP/2.0, a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web. For our readers, it means better browser performance and the unlocking of additional browser functionality that will enable us to further enhance the reader experience. Or in layman’s terms, our pages will load faster.</p>

<p>Thanks to Patrick Malins, the HTTPS Project Manager, and the TNL Technology and Operations teams for their hard work over the past few months.</p>

<p>We elected to set the y-axis domain manually, so it would be identical for both charts. Fixing the y-axis (instead of running it from minimum to maximum) shows how the Oscar transfer to a Chinese club skews the analysis.</p>
<p>French midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin&rsquo;s £24m fee seem little in comparison to Oscar&rsquo;s £60m.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.wsj.com/graphics/elections/2016/how-is-your-state-swinging/">this WSJ piece about swing in US states</a>, we decided to try to flip the coordinates of a rather standard line chart, so to display it vertically.</p>
<p>We decided to call them <em>Snakey charts</em>. And here&rsquo;s <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/basilesimon/e72a435920fffaf2f88a74790e076320">an implementation of them in D3.js</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and that was also the first time the Times played with <a href="http://1wheel.github.io/swoopy-drag/">annotations</a>. Unconvinced by the traditional bendy arrows, the designers asked us to go for straight lines, with a bubble at the top. Which apprently looks more Times-y.</p>

<p>To illustrate where players were coming from as well as the positiong they occupy on the pitch, we produced a set of treemaps, complete with hover-click states, and a mobile view. I must say the Times colour palette produced decent looking results.</p>
