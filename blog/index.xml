I contributed a chapter: ‚ÄúCoding with data in the newsroom‚Äù, which you&amp;rsquo;ll find in the second section, ‚ÄúWorking with data‚Äù, nicely tucked between Barbara Maseda&amp;rsquo;s ‚ÄúText as data: finding stories in text collections‚Äù üòé and Sam Leon&amp;rsquo;s ‚ÄúAccounting for methods: spreadsheets, scripts and programming notebooks.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the Digital Evidence Toolkit</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/announcing-digital-evidence-toolkit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/announcing-digital-evidence-toolkit/</guid><description>üéâ
I&amp;rsquo;m very exited to announce that the Digital Evidence Preservation Toolkit is being funded by the Prototype Fund, a joint venture of the Open Knowledge Foundation and of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research!
Every day, dedicated investigative journalists and human rights monitors scour the Web in search of proof of abuse, wrongdoing, and crime. The material they gather is at risk of being ruled inadmissible and dismissed out of hand in court.</description></item><item><title>Some declarative, React-like logic for your Observable/d3 toolkit</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/hello-d3-render/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/hello-d3-render/</guid><description>Earlier this week, as I was looking into idiomatic ways of updating a chart, I came across Kaho Cheung&amp;rsquo;s d3-render &amp;ndash; and boy did I get excited.
d3-render packages up a bunch of d3 commands in a declarative shell, inspired by a eather functional and reactive approach. @unkleho has got a lovely tutorial introducing the library, but here&amp;rsquo;s another one from yours truly anyway.
Implementation It&amp;rsquo;s going to work this way:</description></item><item><title>Portfolio case study: Machine learning's take on Brexit</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-brexit-rift-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-brexit-rift-machine-learning/</guid><description>An original data-driven experiment looking at how Brexit splits the Tories. Modelling of a dataset to test a hypothesis.
Project course The project came to be as a backburner piece for my contribution to the Europe, Middle East and Africa Reuters file: a kind of backgrounder, explainer story we could mention and push out again every once in a while.
The central question was whether we could back up the feeling Lobby reporters had that there were several groups of Tories, so-called &amp;ldquo;tribes,&amp;rdquo; with different attitudes to Brexit ‚Äî while Labour parliamentarians were relatively united in pushing back against Theresa May&amp;rsquo;s deal.</description></item><item><title>Comparing Berlin memorial street plaques datasets</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/stolpersteine-maps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/stolpersteine-maps/</guid><description>Here are two quite different datasets, which supposedly represent the same thing.

Background In the night of Nov 9 to 10, 1938, Nazi Germany&amp;rsquo;s SA forces carried out a devastating pogrom. The event came to be called Kristallnacht, &amp;ldquo;The Night of Broken Glass.&amp;quot;
Last week, as I walked in the street in the evening I noticed that some of the brass plques had candles and roses next to them, a silent and unattended vigil in the street.</description></item><item><title>Portfolio case study: Reuters' 2019 general election results page</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-general-election-2019-britain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-general-election-2019-britain/</guid><description>A node backend and a modular, reactive front page visualising the UK general election results, as they happened.

Unfortunately, this page was deleted from the internet.

clients must be able to pick and choose which graphics they want, from one of them to all of them, there is only one repository of code I update and push out to clients.</description></item><item><title>A beeswarm layout in Observable -- on deadline</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/observable-beeswarm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/observable-beeswarm/</guid><description>I recently had to complete a technical test for a role I&amp;rsquo;m interested in.
The task: from a story out of the Global Witness website, can you come up with an alternative visualisation? You&amp;rsquo;ve got two hours.
As there were no embed constraints, I figured there was no point in faffing with boilerplate code and scaffolds, so I went down the Observable route to put a chart together.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what we need scales-wise:</description></item><item><title>Portfolio case study: Global Witness' Pipedown interactive map</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-global-witness-pipedown-map/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/portfolio-global-witness-pipedown-map/</guid><description>An interactive map of natural gas infrastructure in the EU, built with Svelte and d3, for Global Witness.
Some context The EU has a rule in place to regulate which electricity and fossil fuel projects it will financially support. These projects include the terminals and pipelines used to import and transport fossil gas ‚Äì sometimes referred to as natural gas. Under this regulation, selected gas projects get fast-track approval and access to billions in public subsidies.</description></item><item><title>Exercising in a 1km radius (another Strava data viz)</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/1km-covid-viz/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/1km-covid-viz/</guid><description>So, I&amp;rsquo;m in France right now, and with this lockdown going on we&amp;rsquo;re quite restricted on the physical exercise front.
Technically we&amp;rsquo;re allowed to go out for a sweat, but can&amp;rsquo;t go for longer than an hour a day, and no further than a one-kilometre radius away rom home.
With this in mind and for no particular reason I set off to cycle, run, or walk every street in this virtual confinement circle.</description></item><item><title>Machine learning's take on the Brexit's House of Commons</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/brexit-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/brexit-machine-learning/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say things are a little confused over here in Brexit Land. To put it lightly, it has become difficult to explain, or simply to fathom what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen next.
A few months ago I looked at the rift splitting the Conservative Party, but the topic kept nagging me.
Obviously the &amp;ldquo;indicative votes&amp;rdquo; were a great tool to identify the Brexit &amp;ldquo;tribes,&amp;quot; as they represented such varied opinions, allowing us to build a mental picture of the different kinds of Brexit MPs could support.</description></item><item><title>noaastorms R package now supports NOAA IBTrACS v4</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/update-noaastorms-r-package/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/update-noaastorms-r-package/</guid><description>Earlier this year, I released a simple R package (available at basilesimon/noaastorms) that downloads, cleans and parses NOAA IBtrack data for you.

The authors present their application of &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; science techniques to datasets coming from the humanities &amp;ndash; mostly large corpus of texts, legends and myths.
One paper in particular uses bioinformatics and phylogenetics to study the spread of a popular folk tale: Little Red Riding Hood. The story that I knew from Perrult and Grimm has patterns that are also found in African and East Asian tales.</description></item><item><title>New R package: load and chart oceanic storms</title><link>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/noaastorms-r-package/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://basilesimon.fr/blog/noaastorms-r-package/</guid><description>Mapping historical storms data is now a little bit easier.

So I grabbed the lot and started playing, and I pen-plotted his journeys on postcards.

The death toll currently stands at nine, and hundreds were injured.
The north western Pacific basin sees many storms, and meteorology agencies release loads of data about climate events such as these.

For us, well, that means a slight change of plans. Throwing the forward planning stuff away and focusing on the big event to come.
